post-container"><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, just like in&nbsp;literature, most characters are divided into good and bad. Usually, the good qualities of&nbsp;those in&nbsp;the “good” group are emphasized, and even if&nbsp;these characters do&nbsp;something bad, they always have strong reasons for&nbsp;it. <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a>’s temper, for example, is&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the fact that he’s being hunted by&nbsp;an&nbsp;evil wizard, while the White Queen’s meanness is&nbsp;revealed only closer to&nbsp;the end.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;evaluate good movie characters impartially because we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;doubts about them.</p><p><h2>Harry Potter&nbsp;— the <i>Harry Potter</i> film series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d45/f59/c283d55faaad775127db30c069.jpg><p>Harry often loses his temper and takes out his anger on&nbsp;others, even on&nbsp;his friends. Remember how irritable he&nbsp;was when he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went</a> to&nbsp;find Horcruxes. Harry lashed out at&nbsp;Hermione and had a&nbsp;fight with Ron. And eventually, he&nbsp;left them out of&nbsp;resentment. We&nbsp;could blame the Horcrux locket for this but all 3&nbsp;wore&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;the same time, Hermione didn’t behave like that, and Ron, although he&nbsp;flared&nbsp;up, returned. It’s unknown whether Harry would have taken the first step to&nbsp;reconcile with his friends.</p><p>Even his attacks on&nbsp;Draco are not always justified. And sometimes they are very sophisticated. In&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> a&nbsp;spell on&nbsp;Malfoy that almost killed him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90c/1e6/351b635014abbe27d4e03352b4.jpg><p>Harry is&nbsp;also arrogant. For example, in&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire</i>, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>celebrates</a> his victory in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the competitions, forgetting about his friends. And once, when talking to&nbsp;Hermione, Harry <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declares</a> himself the chosen one, and immediately receives a&nbsp;well-deserved slap on&nbsp;the head from his friend.</p><p>Harry often acts recklessly like, for example, when he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> Dumbledore’s Army. Not only did he&nbsp;imagine himself an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;Defense Against the Dark Arts, but he&nbsp;also involuntarily set up&nbsp;the director of&nbsp;the school: after the Army was exposed, the professor was fired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/037/0d9/e1c9c05ed2855bebd45b34c708.jpg><p>In&nbsp;general, Potter doesn’t care about the problems of&nbsp;his friends. He&nbsp;doesn’t think about Ron’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feelings</a>, while Ron always has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the shadow of&nbsp;his “chosen” friend. Ron and Hermione’s relationship doesn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bother</a> him. It&nbsp;seems that the function of&nbsp;Harry’s friends is&nbsp;just to&nbsp;save him in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;his misadventures.</p><p>Finally, Harry is&nbsp;self-assured. He&nbsp;always wants to&nbsp;fight evil alone and, for many years, he&nbsp;hasn’t learned to&nbsp;accept help from his friends. At&nbsp;the same time, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;Ginny, he&nbsp;behaves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shy manner, and she always has to&nbsp;take the first step.</p><p><h2>Shaggy and Scooby-Doo&nbsp;— <i>Scooby-Doo</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de2/ce6/7342005e24bd8b70483c54a927.jpg><p>These 2&nbsp;bear little resemblance to&nbsp;heroes who save the world from villains. They are cowardly and run away from danger in&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic instead of&nbsp;helping their friends. Besides, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo always ruin the team’s plans at&nbsp;the most crucial moment, risking everyone’s lives.</p><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>happened</a>, for example, during the fight with the Luna Ghost, who grabbed Daphne. Having failed to&nbsp;fulfill their part of&nbsp;the plan, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo simply ran away and prevented Velma and Fred from doing everything right. And, as&nbsp;always, it&nbsp;was something accidental that helped them not ruin the situation and capture the ghost.</p><p>Shaggy and Scooby-Doo don’t even apologize for their actions. And on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, all their deeds are accompanied by&nbsp;silly humor and laughter. These guys just like to&nbsp;have fun, eat delicious food, and do&nbsp;nothing. And on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, they don’t know how to&nbsp;behave.</p><p><h2>Cady Heron&nbsp;— <i>Mean Girls</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/131/aa6/4e652c5e6f89995bf34a4cec82.jpg><p>The antagonist of&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Regina but Cady, the quiet one, turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;much worse. With her appearance at&nbsp;school, chaos begins. First, she follows the lead of&nbsp;Janis and Damian and, trying to&nbsp;appease her new friends, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agrees</a> to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the plan of&nbsp;ruining the reputation of&nbsp;the “Plastics.” Then Cady completely abandons her studies and her grades in&nbsp;algebra, where she’s always been a&nbsp;strong student, are getting lower and lower because she can’t think about anything else other than Aaron, who she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with.</p><p>Trying to&nbsp;blend in&nbsp;with the “Plastics,” Cady forgets about Janis and Damien and doesn’t even invite them to&nbsp;the party. Eventually, Cady changes her ways but all of&nbsp;her actions are alarming and they set&nbsp;us up&nbsp;to&nbsp;expect another nasty thing from her. This is&nbsp;especially emphasized by&nbsp;the fact that Cady compares the relationships in&nbsp;the group with the cruel laws of&nbsp;the animal world. And in&nbsp;the end, she even hints that the school will have to&nbsp;deal with the new “Plastics” soon.</p><p><h2>Jacob Black&nbsp;— The <i>Twilight</i> film series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af9/ad4/77ab105262bc169253c93713ae.jpg><p>Although some fans of&nbsp;these films believe that Jacob suits Bella better than Edward, his behavior often suggests otherwise. His love for Bella sometimes seems like an&nbsp;unhealthy interest, or&nbsp;maybe even an&nbsp;obsession. Basically, Jacob stalks Bella, forcing her to&nbsp;make him her boyfriend. In&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>third</a> films, he&nbsp;constantly tells her that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;better than Edward, while also insulting him behind his back.</p><p>Jacob’s <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> with Bella is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;selfish motives: it’s not clear whether he&nbsp;would have helped his friend with the bikes if&nbsp;he&nbsp;hadn’t hoped that she would return his feelings. Subsequently, Jacob behaves like a&nbsp;<a href=# title=manipulator data-link=tag>manipulator</a> and a&nbsp;tyrant. He&nbsp;accuses Bella of&nbsp;allegedly taking advantage of&nbsp;his help, is&nbsp;offended that she can’t love him, keeps her from seeing Edward in&nbsp;Italy, and forcibly kisses her. Compared to&nbsp;Edward, who always gives Bella freedom of&nbsp;choice, Jacob looks obsessive and selfish.</p><p><h2>Alice Cullen&nbsp;— The <i>Twilight</i> film series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4e/625/23ae0754c98f65e3f1055a84be.jpg><p>Alice is&nbsp;kind and positive at&nbsp;first glance, but she actually has a&nbsp;finger in&nbsp;every pie. Trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friendly</a> with Bella, Alice doesn’t seem to&nbsp;notice that it’s not easy for Bella to&nbsp;get used to&nbsp;her new friends. Not only is&nbsp;she an&nbsp;introverted person, but she’s also meeting vampires for the first time in&nbsp;her life (which are actually dangerous creatures).</p><p>Alice always imposes her decisions on&nbsp;everyone, and they are sometimes controversial and even risky. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>invites</a> people to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party at&nbsp;the vampire house, despite the fact that there was an&nbsp;incident with Jasper’s attack on&nbsp;Bella. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fills</a> Edward and Bella’s house with clothes that betray her, to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;mildly, unusual taste. And whenever Edward tries to&nbsp;tactfully stop his assertive sister, she genuinely can’t see that she’s doing anything wrong.</p><p><h2>Peeta Mellark&nbsp;— <i>The Hunger Games</i> film series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b4/a8c/00accf5077aed65b180aeb9793.jpg><p>Peeta <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gives</a> the impression of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensitive, even vulnerable young man. But blinded by&nbsp;his love for Katniss, he&nbsp;doesn’t seem to&nbsp;understand that it’s not the best time for love under their circumstances, with both of&nbsp;their lives at&nbsp;stake. Peeta always tries to&nbsp;manipulate her feelings. First, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announces</a> that he&nbsp;loves her. Then he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lies</a>, saying that they are married and that Katniss is&nbsp;pregnant, forcing her to&nbsp;play along.</p><p>Gentle by&nbsp;nature, Peeta stubbornly wants to&nbsp;appear selfless: he&nbsp;volunteers for the games when his participation is&nbsp;not required and separates from Katniss, deciding to&nbsp;act alone. But he&nbsp;gets into trouble over and over again, forcing her to&nbsp;save him. Innocent people die because of&nbsp;him like, for example, mute Mags. In&nbsp;fact, for almost the entire series, Peeta is&nbsp;a&nbsp;burden to&nbsp;everyone around, especially Katniss.</p><p><h2>Mary Jane Watson&nbsp;— The <i>Spider-Man</i> trilogy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6c/ce1/baba0d5e71956d817d9bad5dcb.jpg><p>Mary Jane is&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical “damsel in&nbsp;distress” who always has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rescued</a>. She is&nbsp;forever getting into trouble and waiting for a&nbsp;superhero to&nbsp;come and save her. It’s not until the end of&nbsp;the trilogy that Mary Jane ceases to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;weak-willed and even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>helps</a> Peter Parker a&nbsp;little in&nbsp;the battle with Venom, throwing a&nbsp;concrete block on&nbsp;his head. Although this is&nbsp;where her brave deeds end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/957/baa/647d2e59c2ae513ccf115bf4e4.jpg><p>Perhaps circumstances made her stronger. She used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;spoiled actress who demanded Peter’s full attention and respect for her talent. Remember how Mary Jane was offended if&nbsp;Peter <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>missed</a> her performance, and didn’t even wonder why he&nbsp;couldn’t come. But in&nbsp;the third movie, when she was fired from the theater and began to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;the club, she had to&nbsp;finally come down to&nbsp;earth.</p><p><h2>Ralph de&nbsp;Bricassart&nbsp;— <i>The Thorn Birds</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0b/f52/0d456d549786a09293d6a4ebeb.jpg><p>The young charismatic priest, whose beauty seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfect and whose inner world is&nbsp;mysterious and incomprehensible, made millions of&nbsp;women fall in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love</a> with him at&nbsp;first. Because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;unlike the rest of&nbsp;the clergy it’s no&nbsp;wonder Meggie is&nbsp;drawn to&nbsp;him.</p><p>However, the further the narrative goes, the more your first impression of&nbsp;him dissipates. Ralph wants to&nbsp;achieve the ideal of&nbsp;existence by&nbsp;devoting himself to&nbsp;his work. But a&nbsp;cynical careerist is&nbsp;hiding under the guise of&nbsp;a&nbsp;guardian of&nbsp;spiritual values. After all, Ralph strives not for selfless service, but for ever higher posts all his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0b3/16b/8aeb5c5edfb94d95726e79f313.png><p>Perhaps there is&nbsp;nothing wrong with being ambitious, but Ralph <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wants</a> to&nbsp;satisfy both spiritual and physical needs at&nbsp;the same time, and he&nbsp;doesn’t even think about the fact that he’s playing with poor Meggie’s heart and hurting her feelings. Ralph turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;weak-willed and callous egoist who just wants to&nbsp;keep his foot in&nbsp;both worlds.</p><p><h2>Kate&nbsp;— <i>Last Christmas</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/951/bd5/fecbca5ff48c831087330d6ad1.jpg><p>Kate is&nbsp;an&nbsp;introverted and insecure girl who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>works</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Christmas shop. Her internal issues and problems with the outside world are explained to&nbsp;us by&nbsp;the fact that she had serious heart disease. However, this can’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for her to&nbsp;act as&nbsp;indifferently and irresponsibly as&nbsp;she does.</p><p>She was used to&nbsp;the fact that everyone took care of&nbsp;her, no&nbsp;matter whether a&nbsp;difficult situation occurred. Now she wants to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;her protectors, but she doesn’t know how to&nbsp;lead an&nbsp;adult life. She considers it&nbsp;normal to&nbsp;visit her friends whenever she feels like it&nbsp;and stay with them for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;she wants. Kate doesn’t try to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;normal job or&nbsp;set up&nbsp;her personal life. She fights with her mother and sister and acts like an&nbsp;immature teenager, always complaining about her problems and blaming anyone for them but herself.</p><p><h2>The White Queen&nbsp;— <i>Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland</i> and <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/224/e93/3f980d56a2b1495a0664999128.jpg><p>She always looks elegant dressed in&nbsp;white and she’s polite with everyone around&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how we&nbsp;see the White Queen in&nbsp;the beginning. But this image of&nbsp;her is&nbsp;deceiving. In&nbsp;fact, Mirana and her sister are 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind. She is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;power-seeking as&nbsp;the Red Queen, it’s just that her desires are hiding behind her sweet smile. Mirana doesn’t want to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with Iracebeth and is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fight</a> with her own sister for the throne.</p><p>Even if&nbsp;the White Queen wants to&nbsp;save the world from a&nbsp;cruel ruler, it’s still unclear why she can’t talk to&nbsp;her sister and peacefully sort out the reason for their quarrel. Instead, Mirana chooses the path of&nbsp;passive aggression. Although it&nbsp;is&nbsp;she who is&nbsp;to&nbsp;blame for the conflict. Mirana, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>slandered</a> Iracebeth in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;their parents, making her run away due to&nbsp;resentment. That’s when she stumbled and hit her head so&nbsp;hard that it&nbsp;remained swollen forever.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these characters irritates you and whose flaws are you okay with?
