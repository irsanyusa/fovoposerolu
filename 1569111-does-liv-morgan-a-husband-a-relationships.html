The <a href=#>American wrestler </a>is currently not married. She has, however, been romantically involved with high-profile men in the past. Below is what you need to know about Liv Morgan's relationships.</p><h3>Enzo Amore</h3><p class=align-left>Liv Morgan has dated her fellow<a href=#> professional wrestler</a>, Enzo Amore, who is famous as nZo. His real name is Eric Arndt, and he was signed to WWE's NXT developmental branch in 2012. He won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship twice in 2017.</p><p class=align-left>The two met when Morgan worked at a restaurant, where she had previously worked as a waitress before joining WWE. Enzo Amore was the manager at that restaurant. In an interview with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Monte & Pharaoh,</a></i> Enzo Amore said they grew up in the same area. Liv Morgan told him that she was interested in wrestling.</p><p class=align-left>They started dating when she was in NXT, and in 2017, they ended their relationship. Despite their break up, Enzo Amore said in the aforementioned interview that he was proud of her achievements:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ce9f7e5e0e9a06b3.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Leanne Morganâ€™s age, height, birthday, family, net worth</span></p></a>I hope that she pinches herself and knows that she did it. I'm proud of her. I'm happy for her. No ill will, and vice versa. She's a good human, and she deserves itâ€¦I am proud of herâ€¦am happy for herâ€¦she deserves it.<h3>Tyler Bate</h3><p class=align-left>She allegedly dated Tyler Bate after breaking up with Enzo Amore. Tyler Bate is a professional wrestler who became the youngest inaugural champion in WWE history at nine. The rumours about their relationship resulted from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">some photos</a> that the two posted on social media. The two, however, never confirmed whether the rumours were true.</p><h3>Liv Morgan and Jake Anderson's relationship</h3><p class=align-left>The wiki for WWE The E-Fed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started the rumour</a> about Liv Morgan being in a relationship with a fellow wrestler Jake Anderson. They alleged that the two have been dating since 2020, married in 2021 and divorced in 2023. However, Jake Anderson doesn't seem to exist. The photo used on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wiki page</a> is of actor Stephen Amell, and his whole extensive story appears fabricated.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/78538e0c5a406afb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daphne Ozâ€™s kids: meet the hostâ€™s four young children</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, no reputable source on WWE ever mentions Jake, despite the numerous accolades mentioned in his wiki. Moreover, the photos of his 'ex-wives' are manips (photo manipulations), and the woman <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">purported to be Melissa</a> is actually actress Brie Larson. Thus, it is safe to say that the relationship between Liv Morgan and 'Jake Anderson' comes from someone's imagination.</p><h3>Liv Morgan and Bo Dallas</h3><p class=align-left>The Wrestler is <a id=https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/3-wrestlers-rumored-date-wwe-s-liv-morgan-2022 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly in a relationship </a>with American wrestler Bo Dallas. The two were reportedly seen shopping together at a Publix. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">allegedly live together</a> on a farm owned by the two. However, they have not confirmed if they are in a relationship.</p><h3>Maxwell Jacob Friedman</h3><p class=align-left>Maxwell Jacob Friedman, famous as MJF, is a professional wrestler who worked for <i>Major League Wrestling</i> before signing with<i> All Elite Wrestling</i> in 2019. There <a id=https://www.sportskeeda.com/aew/news-watch-top-aew-star-addresses-dating-rumors-wwe-s-liv-morgan href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">were rumours</a> that Liv was dating MJF. This was after her absence from the ring due to her shoulder injury. Many believed that she was expecting MJF's baby, which was why she was absent.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c5da6e0e1559ffa9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nick Cannonâ€™s girlfriends: who has he dated over the years?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>An <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">account shared</a> a news post stating that Liv Morgan was pregnant with MJF's baby. Surprisingly, the wrestler liked the post, leading fans to question if it was true. Fans thought that she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had cheated</a> on her alleged boyfriend, Bo Dallas, with MJF. However, MJF and Liv Morgan are friends, and they have been friends for a long time.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><li>Who is Liv Morgan?
