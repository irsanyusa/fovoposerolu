Our today’s hero is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, who feels like his family needs him only as&nbsp;a&nbsp;breadwinner. He&nbsp;took to&nbsp;Reddit with his story, seeking other people’s opinions and advice.</p><p><h2>The man took to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;share his concerns with other people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f3/123/7bcb5d5214a2242bb49c55c77b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;desperate man wrote to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Reddit’s communities to&nbsp;tell his family story and to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;other people’s opinions about&nbsp;it.</p><p>He&nbsp;began his post, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «I’ve been married for 8&nbsp;years. I’m 30, my&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;33. We&nbsp;have two kids; a&nbsp;boy, 5, and a&nbsp;girl, 3.»</p><p>The man shared how he&nbsp;usually organizes his routine and how many things he&nbsp;does for his family. He&nbsp;said, «I&nbsp;get up&nbsp;every week day at&nbsp;4:00am. Clean up&nbsp;the litter box, walk the dog, sweep up&nbsp;the house (no&nbsp;vacuum because everyone is&nbsp;still sleeping). I&nbsp;fold the clothes that had dried overnight in&nbsp;the dryer. I&nbsp;check the children’s laundry baskets, and start new loads.»</p><p>After all <a href=# title=chores data-link=tag>chores</a> are done, the man doesn’t take a&nbsp;rest, he&nbsp;continues with other things. He&nbsp;explained, «I&nbsp;go for a&nbsp;three miles run in&nbsp;the dark at&nbsp;5:00am. I’m showered and on&nbsp;the road by&nbsp;6:00am. I&nbsp;commute for an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half to&nbsp;a&nbsp;job I’m not particularly thrilled about, but I’m good at&nbsp;it, and I’m paid well. I’d rather be&nbsp;home building furniture and learning to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;chef.»</p><p>The man ends his day at&nbsp;work, but it&nbsp;doesn’t mean he&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;well-deserved rest afterwards. He&nbsp;said, «Officially I&nbsp;work from 8:00am to&nbsp;5:00pm, but we&nbsp;rarely finish at&nbsp;the office before 6:30pm. I&nbsp;drive home another hour and a&nbsp;half.»</p><p><h2>The man is&nbsp;troubled by&nbsp;the way how his family meets him at&nbsp;home after work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10a/4c7/8aef0155d3834726ce9ddc93f3.jpg><p>The man goes on&nbsp;with his confession, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «When I&nbsp;get home, the house is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mess. There’s no&nbsp;dinner. I’m starving. Did they eat? Yes they did. Uber Eats. Did they order anything for dad? Maybe, if&nbsp;I’m <a href=# title=lucky data-link=tag>lucky</a>. Wife will be&nbsp;on&nbsp;her phone. Daughter sometimes sleeping, sometimes not, son sometimes sleeping, sometimes not.»</p><p>The man admitted that he’d love to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more present in&nbsp;his family. He&nbsp;said, «I’d like to&nbsp;spend time with them, but&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;eat. Bowl of&nbsp;cereal or&nbsp;TV dinner, then.»</p><p>After dinner, he&nbsp;still doesn’t take a&nbsp;minute of&nbsp;rest. The man explained, «I&nbsp;check the laundry machine. Yep. Laundry from this morning is&nbsp;still there, and a&nbsp;huge pile that didn’t even get started is&nbsp;next to&nbsp;the machine. I&nbsp;put the first load into the dryer and start the next ones.»</p><p><h2>The relationship in&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;really tense, without any understanding from both sides.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/226/d1d/9b261450f5809a7cb418ced719.jpg><p>The man goes&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «Wife lectures me&nbsp;on&nbsp;how stressful and hard her day was. How hard can it&nbsp;be&nbsp;when&nbsp;I hired a&nbsp;day nanny. Oh, she means stressful drama with her friends. Oh&nbsp;yes, tell me&nbsp;about what a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;person Brenda is&nbsp;and what a&nbsp;perfect mom she thinks she is&nbsp;and how she’s fake. My, that’s so&nbsp;interesting.»</p><p>The man gets a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> from his spouse. He&nbsp;wrote, «She tells me&nbsp;about how&nbsp;I never have time for any of&nbsp;them and how I’m an&nbsp;absentee father and&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;„step&nbsp;up“ my&nbsp;contribution at&nbsp;home.»</p><p>The man is&nbsp;speaking to&nbsp;his wife in&nbsp;his post, he’s saying, «Well, this weekend&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;mow the lawn and paint the garage and do&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;other chores you insist need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done only by&nbsp;me, I’m sorry if&nbsp;there’s not two of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I can’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;play dates with you.<br>I’m sorry&nbsp;I can’t be&nbsp;like the J&nbsp;Crew family in&nbsp;the ad&nbsp;and be&nbsp;smiling all the time. Someone has to&nbsp;pay for the house you insisted&nbsp;on, the SUVs you insisted&nbsp;on, the Montessori school you insisted&nbsp;on, the fashionable clothes you insisted&nbsp;on, the organic this and that you insisted&nbsp;on, the hair salon and nail appointments you insisted&nbsp;on.<br>Thanks for calling me&nbsp;selfish for spending time on&nbsp;myself on&nbsp;my&nbsp;three-mile runs. It’s the only thing for&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;ever get to&nbsp;do, thanks, and it’s while you’re sleeping.»</p><p><h2>The man described how he&nbsp;sees a&nbsp;happy relationship that he&nbsp;doesn’t have now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f41/08f/d4a9bd5006bd8d25dcaadd7dfa.jpg><p>The man poured his thoughts about things that he&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fed up&nbsp;with. He&nbsp;again spoke to&nbsp;his wife in&nbsp;his post and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «I&nbsp;really wish you wouldn’t condescend to&nbsp;me&nbsp;when you discuss me&nbsp;to&nbsp;your friends, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I’m obsessed with my&nbsp;career and that’s why you’re stuck being supermom. You already know I’m happy with an&nbsp;apartment and used economy cars and buying our clothes at&nbsp;Target and working a&nbsp;job where&nbsp;I get to&nbsp;be&nbsp;home to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;kids.»</p><p>He&nbsp;also criticized his wife, saying, «Why are you and the nanny so&nbsp;busy that your combined efforts can’t put the load of&nbsp;laundry in&nbsp;the dryer and press a&nbsp;button. Why do&nbsp;you leave dishes in&nbsp;the sink for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;after&nbsp;I come home.»</p><p>The man has his own model of&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy family, and he&nbsp;explained how it&nbsp;looks like, «If&nbsp;you want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep working my&nbsp;160k a&nbsp;year job to&nbsp;fun your <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> that’s fine, I’m your hubby and that’s what&nbsp;I signed up&nbsp;for. I’m your man, and it’s my&nbsp;job to&nbsp;support you. I&nbsp;wish you would act like you’re on&nbsp;my&nbsp;side, though, realize that&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;home, but if&nbsp;you want all the stuff you insist are non-negotiable, someone’s got to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out there and pay for them because that all isn’t free.»</p><p>He&nbsp;goes&nbsp;on, saying, «Thing&nbsp;is, all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;more okay if&nbsp;you just said thanks, Mike, I&nbsp;know you’re working hard or&nbsp;us and that you’re doing your part to&nbsp;keep this train rolling. I’m a&nbsp;husband and a&nbsp;father. I’m a&nbsp;workhorse. That’s life.»</p><p>The man admitted in&nbsp;his post that he&nbsp;told his wife how he&nbsp;feels, but she just told him he&nbsp;was being a&nbsp;crybaby. He&nbsp;says, «I&nbsp;don’t think asking you to&nbsp;order something for me&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;dinner is&nbsp;unreasonable. If&nbsp;you really want to&nbsp;impress&nbsp;me, cook something for all of&nbsp;us.»</p><p>The man revealed how he&nbsp;feels about his family, saying, «Marriage is&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership. It&nbsp;feels like I’m doing more of&nbsp;the lifting than half. That’s okay. But I&nbsp;need you to&nbsp;not gaslight me&nbsp;and treat me&nbsp;like I&nbsp;do nothing while you do&nbsp;everything. That’s not cool. I’m not your dad, but&nbsp;I feel like I’ve just taken custody of&nbsp;you and our kids and just get treated badly.»</p><p>The man ended his post, saying, «Please stop rolling your eyes like it’s cringe when&nbsp;I try to&nbsp;play guitar and sing with our kids. They love&nbsp;it. You don’t have&nbsp;to, but please don’t encourage them to&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;me. This is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;contest. This is&nbsp;marriage. I&nbsp;do my&nbsp;part, you do&nbsp;your part. Your part shouldn’t be&nbsp;laughing at&nbsp;my&nbsp;part, thanks.»</p><p><h2>People of&nbsp;Reddit were quick to&nbsp;react to&nbsp;the man’s confession with their comments.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c46/46b/31ab25536c9bc43b109c772b85.jpg><p>People were very supportive of&nbsp;the man in&nbsp;the comments, and they expressed their points of&nbsp;view regarding this situation.</p><p>One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>advised</a>, «Honestly, make her read this; What you wrote. Its very expressive and well written and gets the point across without being mean. Sounds like you need to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;serious sit down with your wife.»</p><p>Another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «My&nbsp;wife claimed she did all the work, constantly to&nbsp;her friends. I&nbsp;thought she was joking around about&nbsp;it. But it&nbsp;turned out she actually thought she was doing ’everything.’<br>We&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;having to&nbsp;sit down and write out what we&nbsp;each did, because apparently&nbsp;I was doing ’nothing.’ I ’won’ with about 4&nbsp;hours more per week. She decided anything outside the house didn’t count (lawns, garden, etc) so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was closer to&nbsp;even. But at&nbsp;least she admitted it&nbsp;was ’fair’ in&nbsp;the end and stopped complaining.»</p><p>And one person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «I&nbsp;think it’s easy for&nbsp;us all to&nbsp;tell you what we&nbsp;think you should&nbsp;do, but it’s like with bad habits&nbsp;— people make changes when they’re ready&nbsp;to.<br>You’re a&nbsp;good father, a&nbsp;good husband, and a&nbsp;good provider. What you’re not is&nbsp;good to&nbsp;you. I&nbsp;hope you can find your next step forward, and not continue to&nbsp;feel like life is&nbsp;more often than not sideways.»</p><p>And here’s yet another confession from a&nbsp;woman, who sacrificed her own feelings and adopted a&nbsp;kid of&nbsp;her husband’s ex-wife, who was not even her husband’s biological son.
