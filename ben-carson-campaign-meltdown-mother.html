She would just say do you have a brain?” the presidential candidate said. “When you accept responsibility you do things in the appropriate way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s just like recently, I had to change some things in my campaign because they simply weren’t working,” Carson continued. “These were people who were supposedly professionals, but they were not getting it done, and we changed it. And it’s working so much better now, it makes all the difference in the world. You always have to be willing to assess the situation and make the appropriate changes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=#>Inside Ben Carson’s Unlikely—And Uncommonly Spiritual—Presidential Campaign</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carson’s top campaign aides announced their resignations in late December, with Barry Bennett and communications director Doug Watts, along with deputy campaign manager Lisa Coen. The shakeup has led to a series of new campaign aides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, Bennet has said that he is helping to advise the Trump campaign, <a href=#>telling TIME that he has wanted to support</a> the eventual nominee. Carson’s new campaign chair, General Bob Dees, said that Bennett’s defection to the Trump camp “validates the decision that were made. We’re seeing a lack of character” from Bennett, Dees told TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A tough race in Iowa between Sen. Ted Cruz and billionaire Donald Trump has largely left Carson behind, but a new <a href=# rel=noopener>Monmouth poll</a> show the neurosurgeon in third place in the Hawkeye state, ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carson often talks about his childhood in poverty in Detroit, where he was raised by a single mother with a third-grade education. He told his audience in Iowa that constant reading helped give him an edge in school. “My mother did that: she saw that I was a terrible student, she recognized that people who were successful tended to be well educated.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After Carson finished and began walking out the door, a reporter asked him whether he was happier with his new campaign staff. “Absolutely,” Carson said. “Yes, absolutely.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaWlmfnKCjpucp2WTlr%2B0u81mmpqloJa2qLqMppylrJSkxK95zKiroZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./la-commission-europeenne-lance-une-campagne-en-faveur-de-la-mobilite-urbaine-durable.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="La Commission europenne lance une campagne en faveur de la mobilit urbaine durable">&larr;
