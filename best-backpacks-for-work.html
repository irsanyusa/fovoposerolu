But for many workers, commuting is back. Whether you've returned to transit twice daily or are heading into an office or coffee shop a couple of times a week, the right backpack can add comfort and organization to your workday. Read on for our picks of the best backpacks for work.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-backpack-for-work>What to consider when buying a backpack for work</h2><h3>Consider your commute</h3><p>Do you live in a big city and commute using public transit? Do you mostly work from home, but go into an office twice a week? These considerations offer insight into the types and styles of work backpacks you might want to consider.</p><p>Any subway rider knows that you need a durable, easy-to-clean fabric or, if you commute in your personal vehicle, straight to an office once or twice a week, you might be able to withstand a more delicate choice, like leather. Considering your commute will help you narrow down choices.</p><h3>Think about your work needs</h3><p>If you work on a laptop and have to carry it around, many work backpacks come with internal laptop pockets that protect the device, but not all. “While the backpack profile is important, it needs the right storage,” says TV personality and fashion expert Cindy Conroy. “Look for a dedicated laptop compartment that has oodles of padding and a slip pocket. Extra brownie points if it’s a zippered compartment.”</p><h3>Choose with comfort in mind</h3><p>One-sided bags, like totes or purses, unevenly distribute weight and, over time, can cause back and neck pain. When choosing a backpack make sure that it is capable of evenly distributing the weight of everything that you carry. This will take the weight off your back and prevent back pain.</p><p>“Just like a new pair of shoes, test-drive possible contenders,” says Conroy. “Ask yourself, ‘Are there air-mesh back panels so you stay cool? Do the straps evenly disperse the weight? Are the straps adjustable or cushioned with ample padding?’”</p><h3>Make sure it’ll last</h3><p>“The allure of an inexpensive polyester backpack is like the scent of a chocolate chip cookie wafting along the path of your commute. It’s irresistible, but is it worth it?” says Controy. “Nylon and coated canvas are superior options if durability is at the top of your must-have list. Both are easy to clean, too.”</p><h3>Know your budget</h3><p>Even if your budget is on the lower side, you don’t have to settle for a basic bag—instead, look for details that have an expensive look. “Pick backpacks with supple faux leather, gold-tone hardware, or color blocking: These decadent accents elevate an affordable selection without breaking the bank,” Conroy says.</p><h2 id=top-backpack-picks-for-work>Top backpack picks for work</h2><h3>Best work backpack for staying organized: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Briggs Riley Rhapsody Essential Backpack</a></h3><p>Type A personalities will love this backpack, with pouches and compartments for any of your work needs.
