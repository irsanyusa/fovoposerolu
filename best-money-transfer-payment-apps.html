This platform allows for protected transactions between businesses and customers, as well as the ability to send money between individuals. To date, PayPal has helped facilitate over $1.36 trillion in payment transactions across more than 200 markets worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>With <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>PayPal</a>, you can send money from almost anywhere in the world using your bank account, debit or credit card, or an existing <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>PayPal</a> account balance.

But what if you want to send money to someone who doesn’t have a bank account, or you need to find a way to safely send cash either domestically or internationally?</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Western Union</a> has been around since 1851 and began offering money transfers as early as 1871. While you could originally send funds only between New York, Chicago, and Boston, Western Union now provides money transfer services in more than 200 countries.</p><p>With the <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Western Union</a>, you can use your bank account, credit card, or debit card to send money to others, or you can deposit cash at an in-store location. The recipient can then receive their funds on the other end in a few different ways, including picking up cash at an agent location near them.</p><p>The fees for sending funds through Western Union vary depending on where you’re sending money from, where the recipient is located, how you’re funding the transfer, how much you’re sending, and how the recipient will receive the funds. It takes anywhere from a few minutes to multiple business days before the funds are available.</p><h3>Best for mobile transfers: Venmo</h3><p><span class=best-for>Mobile transfers</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Mobile transfers</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Venmo</h3><p>Costs</p><p>From free to 3%</p><p>Max transaction limit</p><p>Up to $5,000 per transfer to your bank, up to $10,000 per week into your Venmo account</p><p># of countries</p><p>1</p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Pros & cons</h3></p><h3 class=title>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Free to use.</li><li>Allows for payments to friends/family or businesses (with purchase protection).</li><li>One of the most popular payment apps in the world.</li></ul><h3 class=title>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Funds aren’t immediately available in your bank account.</li><li>Fees are charged for Instant Transfer.</li><li>No option to receive cash.</li></ul><p>Released in 2009, Venmo is a popular subsidiary of the fintech giant, PayPal. Venmo was originally touted as a great way to send funds to friends, especially when it came to things like splitting the dinner bill or sharing expenses with roommates. Venmo’s mobile app has since gained around 90 million users, or about a third of U.S. adults. It quickly became one of the most popular payment apps in the world.</p><p>With Venmo, users can connect a savings account, checking account, or even a credit card for funding purposes. They can use these connected accounts to send money to friends, split bills, send gifts, or pay businesses for online or in-person purchases.</p><p>Any received funds can be transferred to the bank account of your choosing in one to three business days. Want your cash faster? Instant Transfer gives you access to your cash within just minutes for a fee of 1.5% (minimum of $0.25 and maximum of $15).</p><p>Venmo also offers a connected credit card, allowing users to pay for purchases and earn up to 3% cash back. You can even purchase and manage a cryptocurrency wallet through the Venmo app. And if you pay for goods and services with Venmo, your eligible purchase is protected if something goes wrong.</p><p>Venmo is free to download and use. There are fees for expedited withdrawals to a bank account, as well as a 3% fee if you send money to someone else using a connected credit card account (linked bank account payments have no fees). Businesses also pay a 1.9% fee plus $0.10 of any received payments over a dollar.</p><h3>Best for instant transfers between banks: Zelle</h3><p><span class=best-for>Instant transfers between banks</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Instant transfers between banks</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Zelle</h3><p>Costs</p><p>No fees</p><p>Max transaction limit</p><p>Daily and rolling monthly limits vary by financial institution</p><p># of countries</p><p>1</p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Pros & cons</h3></p><h3 class=title>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Funds are deposited into the connected bank account instantly.</li><li>No fees for either user.</li><li>Enrollment is secure and typically done through your bank’s mobile app or online platform.</li></ul><h3 class=title>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Transfers only allowed between enrolled users.</li><li>Not available through all financial institutions.</li><li>Connected account is the only funding option (no sending funds from a credit card, etc.).</li></ul><p>Zelle is a money transfer platform that connects with your U.S.-based bank or credit union accounts. With Zelle, you can instantly move money from one enrolled bank account to the next, whether you’re sending funds to a loved one or paying for something you bought on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>Rather than these funds landing in a middleman platform and then needing to be withdrawn to another bank account, Zelle allows you to make transfers that instantly withdraw from one bank account and deposit into the next. In most cases, this means that the funds are available for use right away.</p><p>In order to use Zelle, both users must enroll through the Zelle mobile app or their bank’s online banking platform. A U.S. checking or savings account is required to enroll. There is no fee to use Zelle’s services, and it’s available through more than 1,700 financial institutions.</p><p>Zelle isn’t a payment platform, so you can’t use it to make online purchases through a merchant’s website. You also won’t be offered any purchase protection if you pay a seller directly, and there is no option for disputing a transfer once it’s been sent. Be sure to send Zelle payments only to individuals you know and/or trust.</p><h2 id=best-alternative-to-apps-to-transfer-money>Best alternative to apps to transfer money</h2><p>Not sure if you’re comfortable with a mobile money transfer app? Here are two other options to consider.</p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Lili</a></h3><p>If you run your own company, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Lili</a> can help you manage your business checking and send or receive funds via seamless ACH transfer. This fintech charges no hidden fees, has no overdraft charges, and sets no minimum balance or deposit requirements to open or maintain an account.</p><p>If you need to send money to others, you have the option of standard or express ACH through connected payment apps.

Some of these are standalone apps, while others are easily integrated with some of the best banks and financial institutions.</p><p>Some of these apps offer free money transfers to family and friends while also providing you with certain purchase protections when you buy from a merchant. Others are designed to help you send cash across the world safely and affordably.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do money transfer apps work?</h3><p>Money transfer apps work by sending a digital payment, ACH transfer, or domestic or international wire from a sender (who funds the transaction) to a recipient. Depending on the app, these funds might be automatically deposited into a bank account, readily spent using a connected debit card, available for cash withdrawal, or can be transferred to another linked bank account.</p><p>In some cases, funds can be sent by depositing cash at an in-person location, and can even be picked up in the form of cash by the recipient. If funds are sent from one eligible country to another, these apps will also facilitate currency conversion from sender to recipient.</p><h3>How much do money transfer apps cost?</h3><p>Many money transfer apps are available free of charge, especially if you are sending cash domestically or to friends and family. Others charge fees on the merchant side if you use the app to make a purchase for goods or services.</p><p>There may be fees involved if you opt to transfer money through an app using a credit card, need an expedited transaction, or if the cash needs to change currencies. These fees can vary from a dollar or two up to hundreds of dollars, depending on how much you want to send and how you plan to fund the transaction.</p><h3>Are money transfer apps safe?</h3><p>Most money transfer apps are financial technology companies (fintech) with highly encrypted platforms to keep your money and information as safe as possible. Most of these companies are licensed and regulated by agencies in the U.S. and abroad. Even still, it’s important to send money only to people you know and trust, as there are very few (if any) protections available once your funds have been sent.</p><h3>How long does it take to transfer money with an app?</h3><p>Many apps allow you to send funds to others instantly. Depending on the platform, these funds may need to be transferred out to a connected bank account before they can be spent, or they may be immediately available in the account of your choosing.</p><p>Other platforms, especially those facilitating international transfers, may take minutes or even days before the funds are available.</p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash App</a> vs. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>PayPal</a>—which is better?</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash App</a> is a great choice if you want to send money to others through an app without fees, while also having access to a connected debit card and even the option to pay in cryptocurrency. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Paypal</a> may be the better choice, however, if you’re buying goods or services and want purchase protection, or completing an online transaction.</p><h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Remitly</a> vs. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>MoneyGram</a>—which is better?</h3><p>Both <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Remitly</a> and <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>MoneyGram</a> offer international money transfers with currency conversion and multiple funding options. With both companies, fees are noted upfront and you can track your money transfer every step of the way. In many cases, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>MoneyGram</a> money transfers may be available in as soon as a few minutes, while <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Remitly</a> offers home delivery services for money transfers, simplifying the entire process for your recipient.</p><h5>The Revolut USA Prepaid Visa® and Prepaid Mastercard® are issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A.
