In addition, buying bed linens is also a way to transition and decorate your bedrooms and guest rooms from season to season. With so many bedding companies selling everything from <a rel=alternate href=#>bamboo sheets</a> to hand-made quilts, though, it can be overwhelming to decide where to shop for your next favorite set of sheets or the perfect winter blanket.</p><p>We dug deep under the covers to review myriad retailers, comparing (and trying out) bedding options from wool blankets to delicate pillowcases, to create a list of 15 of the best one-stop shops for bedding, based on each shop’s selection of comfort, style, affordability, and products. No matter your budget, we recommend building the bedding wardrobe of your linen closet’s dreams.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-places-to-buy-bedding>Our top picks for the best places to buy bedding</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Garnet Hill</a></h3><p>Fans of cottage-core and modern farmhouse design lovers should put Garnet Hill at the top of their bedding list.

Its duvet covers come in linen or bamboo and are made to fit all bed types from twin to king. Sleepers rave about their comfort, making it clear that this is not the duvet you remember from your dorm room.

(In fact, Cariloha’s bamboo sheets topped our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bamboo sheets</a>.) If you want to support a B-Corp company dedicated to the sustainable production of its environmentally friendly offerings, Cariloha is the way to go, with its sustainable bamboo viscose sheet sets, quilts, blankets, and duvet cover throws, all made to repel odors and allergens.

If you need pillows, this is a great place for a variety of them (their down alternative pillow made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a>). The site also offers recommendations for the best pillows for particular sleep positions. Its blankets, quilts, and duvet covers are offered in classic neutral colors, so if you’re looking for affordable, quality bedding but don’t mind a lack of style options, Saatva is a solid choice.

Bean</a></h3><p>If you’re searching for soft flannel sheets, woolen camp blankets, and classic New England styles, L.L. Bean, a Maine mainstay, is a great place to shop for affordable, comfortable, and well-made bedding. Some of the styles may seem nostalgic, like its blueberry patterned sheets (think coastal grandma) or buffalo checked throw blankets (cabin chic), so if you’re looking for silk or satin bedding or all-organic bedding, this might not be the shop for you. However, their classic designs (nautical stripes, solids, checks, and sweet florals) and flannel sheets, quality quits, and made-in-Maine blankets will likely last years with the proper care.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Product variety: Pima cotton sheet sets, premium Egyptian cotton sheets, mattress pads, quilts, blankets, comforters, covers, throws, pillows (and their cases), kids' bedding, and bed skirts</li><li>Return window: 1 year</li><li>Return policy: “If you are not 100% satisfied with one of our products, you may return it within one year of your purchase for a refund (special conditions may apply)”</li><li>Payment options: Major credit cards and PayPal</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Warm and ultra-soft flannel sheets</li><li>Quality quilts</li><li>One-year return window</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not a lot of organic options, if that’s an important factor for you</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Visit L.L. Bean Store</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Schoolhouse</a></h3><p>Schoolhouse is a modern farmhouse dream, selling a variety of well-made and attractive home goods, furniture, rugs, and accessories,all referred to as “modern American heirlooms.” Its bedding selection is as quirky and stylish as its other products. The all-cotton sheets (made in Portugal) selection is limited, but the prints, from pretty florals, gingham checks, and colorful confetti, are worth checking out. Schoolhouse sells heavy cotton coverlets (i.e., blankets) that look good on a bed and will keep you somewhat warm, especially if you add one of Schoolhouse’s vintage-inspired cotton quilts in polka dots or diamond ticking. You might only buy some of your bedding here, but a few well-chosen pieces will upgrade your bedroom or guest room in the style department.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Product variety: Sheets, pillowcases and shams, quilts, throw pillows, blankets, and coverlets</li><li>Return window: 30 days</li><li>Return policy: “Items eligible for a return must be returned within 30 days of delivery”</li><li>Payment options: PayPal and major credit cards</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><p>Lovely prints and fabrics</p><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Limited offerings on bedding</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Visit Schoolhouse Store</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>SOL Organics</a></h3><p>SOL Organics sells lightweight, breathable sheets, duvets, pillowcases, and shams. Pick up percale or sateen cotton, linen, or brushed flannel sheets and pair them with a duvet in the same four fabric choices.

If you love clean design lines, sea blues, and beachy stripes, you will want to shop here. Like most things at Serena & Lily, the bedding is expensive due to the high-quality materials, but if you shop its seasonal sales, you can often find mark-downs on lightweight linen and crisp, cool cotton sheets, soft throws, and more. You can mix and match sheets, duvets, and anything else from Serena & Lily collections because (most) of the colors are complementary.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Product variety: Sheets, blankets, throws, shams and pillowcases, duvet covers, quilts and coverlets, bed skirts, bed inserts, and protectors</li><li>Return window: 60 days</li><li>Return policy: “All bedding, mattresses, and select bath products can be returned for a full merchandise refund within 60 days of receipt.”</li><li>Payment options: Major credit cards, Affirm</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Range of offerings</li><li>Linen sheets</li><li>Return window</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>More colors to choose from would be appreciated</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Visit Serena & Lily Store</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklinen</a></h3><p>Brooklinen understands what consumers love in their bedrooms—at least in terms of what goes on the bed. The company that sells the "Internet's favorite (and award-winning) sheets" sells all the bedding you need, from duvet covers to quilts and throw blankets. Its sheet sets come in soft fabrics like heathered cashmere or brushed flannel for cooler nights, and linen and organic cotton for warmer ones.

It can get expensive just for sheets, but Brooklinen lets you personalize (and save on) bedding bundles so you can choose your colors and give your set a personal color touch. Also worth noting: Brooklinen’s sheets come with Oeko-Tex certification, making them a great option for sleepers with sensitive skin or allergies, along with mulberry silk pillowcases, which are good for your skin and hair, too.</p><h4>Good to know:</h4><ul><li>Product Variety: Sheets, comforters, duvet covers, throw blankets, bedding bundles, quilts and shams, mattress toppers, kids’ and baby bedding, and mulberry silk pillowcases and sleep accessories</li><li>Return window: 365 days</li><li>Return policy: “Most of our products can be returned or exchanged within 365 days.

Watch for sales on your favorite fabrics and designs to minimize the cost. It’s worth considering that high-quality bedding (that’s well cared for) will last longer than a set of cheap sheets. In addition, comfortable bedding may enhance your sleep experience, which is crucial for good health. Decide where you can save and where you can splurge for your bedding.</p><p>Here’s a tip for saving money: Sometimes, kids' bedding is less expensive than its grown-up counterpart. If you sleep in a full or queen-sized bed, it can be worth searching kid bedding for sheets and blankets. Not everything for children is branded and some patterns might work great for an older kid or adult’s room.</p><h3>Bedding sets</h3><p>Buying your bedding in bulk by purchasing sets can save more than when buying individual items. Consider purchasing one with a full set of sheets, extra pillowcases, and a <a rel=alternate href=#>duvet or comforter</a>.</p><h3>Bed size</h3><p>Make sure you have the measurements of all your beds before purchasing sheets. Sometimes, what looks like a twin is a twin x-large, and some kids’ (and grown-up) beds, especially, may have slightly less-than-standard sizes, depending on the manufacturer. When in doubt, check out our guide to <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress sizes and bed dimensions</a>.</p><h3>Fabrics</h3><p>Some like linen, while others prefer cotton. In the winter, brushed flannel may appeal. If you have allergies to feathers, it is advisable to stay away from down. Look for Oeko-Tex certification, especially if you have sensitive skin.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-places-to-buy-bedding>How we selected the best places to buy bedding</h2><p>To choose the best places to buy bedding, we reviewed multiple national retailers as if we were purchasing bedding for our own rooms. We interviewed friends and colleagues, asked interior designers about their favorite places to shop, and included a review of the following:</p><ul><li>Retailer’s selection of fabrics, prints, and colors</li><li>Selection of bedding options and how many products are available</li><li>Advertised prices and available discounts</li><li>Ease of ordering</li><li>Return policy</li><li>Pricing (on individual items and bundles)</li><li>Whether or not they offered Oeko-Tex certification and organic options</li><li>Customer service reviews</li></ul><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What’s the best time to buy bedding?</h3><p>Experts say January is the best time to save big on bedding, but also check out end-of-summer sales and stock your linen closet for next year.</p><h3>What makes high-quality bedding?</h3><p>Durable fabrics like linen that can help regulate your body temperature in both cool and warm weather, organic and Oeko-Tex certified cotton, and natural materials like bamboo and silk are all high-quality bedding. Often, the type of fabric and how the manufacturer uses it determines if a piece of bedding is “high quality” or not.</p><h3>What type of bedding lasts the longest?</h3><p>According to data from the Better Sleep Council, the average consumer will replace their sheet sets approximately every 3.5 to 3.7 years, but some quality bedding will last longer. It’s a good rule of thumb to assume that organic cotton, linen, or bamboo blends may last longer than polyester blended sheets.</p><p>Handmade or high-quality quilts and wool blankets can last decades (or even generations in some cases) if cared for properly over their lifetime. In terms of long-lasting bedding, the higher the quality, the longer it will last.</p><h3>Is a higher thread count better?</h3><p>Not necessarily, because of the many factors that go into making a great sheet. For example, Egyptian cotton may have a higher thread count than a standard cotton sheet, but the real reason it’s so comfortable is that it’s woven from long fibers. Organic cotton will have a softer feel and even more longevity, whatever the thread counts, because it is free from pesticides and other chemicals that may keep it from being as soft as its natural counterpart. Of course, when it comes to bedding, whatever helps you get a good night’s sleep and feels good to your body ultimately counts the most.
