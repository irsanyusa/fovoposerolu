Once you add money to the card, you can use it as you would use a traditional debit card. Uses might include withdrawing cash, paying bills, or purchasing online or in a store.</p><p>The main benefit of reloadable debit cards is the ability to add only as much money as you need. This prevents you from overdrawing your account or going into debt. Result—a flexibility that makes them a useful tool when it’s important to limit spending, such as with a child who gets their first debit card. The cards on this list are among the best prepaid debit cards available today.</p><h2 id=best-prepaid-debit-cards-compared-2024>Best prepaid debit cards compared 2024</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 bQCais not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 hkFKev"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 hGTrVQ" readability=37.616231086657><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Cash App Customers</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=3.4035087719298><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Walmart customers</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=2.4615384615385><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Pairing with a savings account</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=5><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Bluebird by American Express</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Avoiding fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Over 37,000 MoneyPass® ATM locations</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=8><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Serve American Express Prepaid Debit Account</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Earning rewards</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>$0 in network, $3.95 out of network</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Over 45,000 retail locations</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>ONE VIP Visa Prepaid Card</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Supporting underserved communities</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>FamZoo Prepaid Card</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>$4.95 for cash</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=2><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Greenlight Prepaid Mastercard</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Kids/teens</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=5><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4><p>Movo Virtual Prepaid Visa Card</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Virtual debit cards</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Varies, typically $3.95 or $4.95</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Not available</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=our-recommendations-for-the-best-reloadable-debit-card>Our recommendations for the best reloadable debit card</h2><h3>Best for Cash App customers: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash App Card</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Cash Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Not available</p><p>If you regularly use Cash App, the <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash Card</a> is a convenient way to access the money in your Cash App account. The card is a <a rel=alternate href=#>Visa</a>, so it’s accepted at most online and retail stores. Stored balances on your <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash Card</a> are FDIC-insured up to $250,000, so your money is safe. Another benefit of this card is that you can add offers via the Cash App, allowing you to save money on purchases.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel=alternate href=#>Cash App Review</a></strong></p><p>However, this card doesn’t earn rewards in the form of cash back, so you won’t get extra earnings on every purchase. In addition, no free ATM network is available. You will pay $2.50 any time you make a withdrawal, even at in-network ATMs. Out-of-network ATMs may charge an additional fee.</p><h3>Best for Walmart customers: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Walmart MoneyCard</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Walmart Money Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere.</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Not available</p><p>Purchases at Walmart.com earn 3% cash back with this card, while purchases at Walmart fuel stations earn 2% cash back. At Walmart stores you will earn 1% cash back. You can also earn 2% <a rel=alternate href=#>annual percentage yield (APY)</a> on savings, up to a maximum average daily balance of $1,000. There is also up to $200 of overdraft protection and no monthly fee. Despite this card’s benefits, there is a big caveat to keep in mind: Cash back is limited to just $75 annually.</p><h3>Best for pairing with a savings account: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Netspend® Visa® Prepaid Card</a></h3><h3 class=product-title>Netspend® Visa® Prepaid Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>Up to $3.95</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Not available</p><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Netspend® Visa® Prepaid Card</a> has many benefits, including no credit check, no minimum balance requirements, and no activation fees. In addition, you can get paid via direct deposit up to two days early. There is also a “purchase cushion” that will cover you for up to $10 if you don’t have enough money to pay for a purchase.</p><h3>Best for avoiding fees: Bluebird by American Express</h3><h3 class=product-title>Bluebird Prepaid Debit Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere.</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Over 37,000 MoneyPass® ATM location</p><p>The Bluebird by American Express has the lowest fees overall.

You can make free cash withdrawals at 37,000 locations in the MoneyPass ATM network. Plus, you can use the card to get paid up to two days sooner with Early Direct Deposit.</p><h3>Best for earning rewards: Serve American Express Prepaid Debit Account</h3><h3 class=product-title>Serve Prepaid Debit Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere.</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Over 45,000 retail locations</p><p>The Serve prepaid debit account from Amex earns unlimited 1% cash back on in-store and online purchases. Funds are added to your account as soon as the transaction settles with Serve. Debit cards aren’t known for earning cash back (that’s usually the province of credit cards), making the Serve prepaid debit account a notable exception. You can redeem your cash back on purchases made in-store or online.</p><h3>Best for supporting underserved communities: ONE VIP Visa Prepaid Card</h3><h3 class=product-title>ONE VIP Visa Prepaid Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere.</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Over 45,000 retail locations</p><p>The ONE VIP Visa Prepaid Card is another prepaid card that earns cash back. This includes one point for every $2 you spend, plus 1.5 points for every $1 spent on Netflix, Uber, Sephora, and at select Black-owned businesses. Currently, there is a list of 25 Black-owned businesses that earn 1.5 points per $1 spent. The downsides are that this card has a $7.95 monthly fee and lacks a free ATM network.</p><h3>Best for families: FamZoo Prepaid Card</h3><h3 class=product-title>FamZoo Prepaid Card</h3><p>Cash reloads fees</p><p>$0 with Walmart app, $3 at Walmart locations, up to $5.95 elsewhere.</p><p>Free ATM network</p><p>Not available</p><p>The FamZoo Prepaid Card is great for the whole family.

In addition, the card uses the Mastercard network, so millions of merchants in the U.S. and worldwide accept it. You can also use your card at a Mastercard ATM in your area.</p><h2 id=our-methodology>Our methodology</h2><p>We selected the best prepaid credit cards based primarily on which cards have the lowest fees for cash reloads. Similarly, we also considered which cards have the largest networks of free ATMs. We also screened for other factors, such as finding prepaid cards that work well for families. Overall, we looked for cards that meet the needs of prepaid cardholders, which may differ from those with traditional debit cards.</p><h2 id=how-to-select-the-best-prepaid-debit-card>How to select the best prepaid debit card</h2><p>There are many features you may look for in a prepaid debit card, and those features won’t always be the same. However, below are some features for those with a prepaid debit card.</p><h3>Low fees</h3><p>Prepaid debit cards often come with fees, and no one likes paying just to access their money. Fees might include monthly fees, cash reload fees, and ATM withdrawal fees. Pay attention to the fees and look for a prepaid debit card that doesn’t have an excessively long list of them.</p><h3>Free ATM network</h3><p>Most prepaid debit cards don’t come from big banks with a vast network of ATMs. This could be a problem, as you typically must pay a fee to withdraw cash from an ATM that isn’t in your network. However, some prepaid debit cards partner with large ATM networks, enabling fee-free withdrawals at ATMs around the country.</p><h3>Ease of reloading</h3><p>Reloading your prepaid debit card shouldn’t be a challenge, and the best cards have many reload options. This might include cash reloads, direct deposits, or bank transfers. Before signing up for a prepaid debit card, check to see if you can use your preferred reload method.</p><h3>Benefits and perks</h3><p>Prepaid debit cards sometimes have extra benefits and perks, such as cash back, rewards programs, or discounts at certain retailers. While these are mostly an added bonus, they could tip the scales if you are trying to decide between two cards. However, it’s worth noting that the prepaid debit cards with the best perks sometimes have monthly fees.</p><h2 id=low-fee-alternatives-to-prepaid-cards>Low-fee alternatives to prepaid cards</h2><p>Prepaid debit cards can be useful, but they may not always be the best choice. Depending on the situation, one of these low-fee alternatives may be worth considering:</p><ul><li><a rel=alternate href=#>Online checking accounts</a>. These accounts let you manage your money online, often with no monthly fees or minimum balances. Online banks typically have no physical branches, and they share those savings with customers. What’s more, these banks usually offer debit cards, giving you easy access to your money.</li></ul><h3 class=product-title>Chase Total Checking®</h3><p>Monthly fee</p><p>$12</p><p>Min. deposit</p><p>$0</p><p>Bonus</p><p>New Chase checking customers enjoy a&nbsp;$300&nbsp;bonus when you open a Chase Total Checking®&nbsp;account with qualifying activities</p><ul><li>Credit unions. Some credit unions may have lower fees than large banks. They also may be more willing to work with families and underserved communities. Of course, this varies by credit union, but it’s worth investigating choices in your area.</li><li>Mobile money management apps. Apps such as <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Paypal</a> offer money management services. In addition, they offer a debit card, allowing you to use them much as you would a prepaid debit card.</li><li>Mobile payment apps. Mobile apps such as <a rel=alternate href=#>Venmo</a> and <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Cash App</a> also offer a debit card without charging monthly fees. These let you use only as much money as you have in your account, similar to a prepaid debit card.</li><li>Secured credit cards. If you haven’t established a healthy credit history, a secured credit card can help you build your credit. These often report to the major credit bureaus, and some don’t charge usage fees.</li></ul><p>The best choice depends on your personal situation. However, it’s best to look for options that do away with excessive fees and make it easy to access your money.</p><h2 id=where-to-buy-prepaid-debit-cards>Where to buy prepaid debit cards</h2><p>There are many ways to buy prepaid debit cards, both online and in person. Below are some common places and methods.</p><h3>Online</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to buy a prepaid debit card is often on the card issuer’s website. Check the websites of the card issuers mentioned in the list above, as you can typically sign up online. For those who don’t have internet access, one of the methods below might work.</p><h3>Retail stores</h3><p>You can check your local retail stores to see if they sell prepaid debit cards. This might include grocery stores, convenience stores, and large retailers such as Target and Walmart. You may find them near the cashiers or in a display case near other financial products, like gift cards.</p><h3>Bank and credit union branches</h3><p>Some banks and credit unions offer prepaid debit cards to their customers. Even if you don’t have a checking or savings account with them, you can still visit a branch near you and ask if it offers prepaid debit cards.</p><h3>Check cashing stores</h3><p>Check cashing or payday loan stores sometimes offer prepaid debit cards along with their other products. If you visit one of these stores, you can find out if it offers prepaid debit cards.</p><h3>Pharmacies</h3><p>Large pharmacy chains, such as Walgreens and CVS, often have prepaid debit cards available for purchase. If you intend to visit one of these stores soon, look for prepaid cards near the front of the store.</p><h2 id=prepaid-vs-regular-debit-cards-whats-the-difference>Prepaid vs regular debit cards: What’s the difference?</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 bQCais not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 hkFKev"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 hGTrVQ" readability=31><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Typical funding source</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5><p>Cash reloads, direct deposit, bank transfers</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Checking account</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=8><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Possible fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5><p>Maintenance fees, ATM fees, overdraft fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell" readability=5><p>Cash reloads, cash withdrawals, balance inquiry</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Overdrafts possible?</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"><p>Builds credit?</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 hGJufp table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=time-stamp-prepaid-debit-cards-are-safe-and-convenient-but-watch-the-fees>TIME Stamp: Prepaid debit cards are safe and convenient, but watch the fees</h2><p>Prepaid debit cards let you add money in advance and use them as needed. You can typically only spend up to the amount on the card, and overdrafts aren’t usually possible. This can help control overspending and be a good option for those who are unbanked. Just pay attention to the fees, which can be high.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do prepaid debit cards work?</h3><p>Prepaid debit cards allow you to add money to the card in advance.

In some cases there may not be a fee to cancel the card if it has a zero balance. Others may charge a fee to close the account or for sending a check with the remaining balance. Check your card’s terms and conditions for specifics about fees.</p><h3>How do you add money to a reloadable debit card?</h3><p>There are many options, including in-person cash deposits, bank transfers, direct deposits, and check deposits via mobile app. Remember that there may be fees associated with some or all of these methods, so check with your card issuer for details.</p><h3>How do you apply for a prepaid debit card?</h3><p>Often, the easiest and most straightforward way to apply is through the card issuer’s website.
