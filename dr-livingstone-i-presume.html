Though it was an ancient mystery, mere geographical accomplishments took second place to his passionate desire for ending the East African Arab-Swahili slave trade.</p><p>He is reported to have said: "The Nile sources are valuable only as a means of opening my mouth with power among men. It is this power with which I hope to remedy an immense evil."</p><p>In fact, he never did find the source. It was discovered by Sir <a href=#>Richard Francis Burton</a>, English scholar, traveller and translator of the Arabian Nights.</p><p>Livingstone at least had the consolation of being the first European to see the Mosi-o-Tunya (the "Smoke that Thunders") waterfall. Describing it later, he wrote: "Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight." Livingstone honoured his Queen by calling it Victoria Falls.</p><p>Pushing through what is now Tanzania with more than 100 porters, many of whom deserted or became incapacitated by tropical disease, Stanley was to finally encounter his quarry in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in 1871.</p><p>Livingstone was clearly thin, ill and weak – and surrounded by a possibly unfriendly tribe.</p><p>Theologian and writer the Very Rev William Garden Blaikie was later asked by Livingstone's family to write a biography of the adventurer. His book, The Life of David Livingstone, published in 1880, includes an account of the historic encounter:</p><p>'As I advanced towards him,' says Mr Stanley, 'I noticed he was pale, looking wearied, had a grey beard, wore a bluish cap with a faded gold band round it, had on a red-sleeved waistcoat and a pair of grey tweed trousers.</p><p>'I would have run to him, only I was a coward in the presence of such a mob, – would have embraced him, only he being an Englishman, I did not know how he would receive me; so I did what cowardice and false pride suggested was the best thing – walked deliberately to him, took off my hat and said:</p><p>'Dr Livingstone, I presume?'</p><p>'Yes,' said he, with a kind smile, lifting his cap slightly.</p><p>I replace my hat on my head, and he puts on his cap, and we both grasp hands, and then I say aloud:</p><p>'I thank God, Doctor, I have been permitted to see you.'</p><p>He answers: 'I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you.'</p><p>A greeting hardly as stirring as Veni Vidi Vici, or I Have A Dream, but the words became famous partly because of their humour: apart from Livingstone there was no white man around for hundreds of miles.</p><p>David Livingstone died two years later from malaria, aged 60.</p><p><b>Published:</b> <i>March 4, 2018</i><br><b>Updated:</b> <i>November 15, 2019</i></p><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Articles on Events in March</h2></a><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/pascal-blaise-sml.jpg alt="The First People To Hop On A Bus" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The First People To Hop On A Bus</h3><span class=linked_text>It was an idea probably two centuries years ahead of its time, but public buses first took to the streets of Paris on this day in history.</span><span class=linked_date>March 18, 1662</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/manual-noriega-upon-arrest-in-1990-sml.jpg alt="A First Lady Goes Shoplifting" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>A First Lady Goes Shoplifting</h3><span class=linked_text>While former Panama military dictator Manuel Noriega was awaiting his fate on racketeering charges, his wife Felicidad was having her own run-in with the law.</span><span class=linked_date>March 20, 1992</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/burlington-arcade-beadle-sml.jpg alt="Welcome Shoppers, But No Whistling Please" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Welcome Shoppers, But No Whistling Please</h3><span class=linked_text>Burlington Arcade, one of London's finest shopping streets, was opened on this day, partly as a deterrent to litter louts.</span><span class=linked_date>March 20, 1819</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/eleanor-of-aquitaine-sml.jpg alt="The Most Expensive Divorce in History" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Most Expensive Divorce in History</h3><span class=linked_text>Beautiful and rich, Eleanor of Aquitaine had one fault according to the King of France: she had not produced a son.
