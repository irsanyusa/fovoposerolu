Perhaps you just received an unexpected bill, or your car broke down and needs extensive work. Whatever the reason, you might find yourself needing to make quick money in one day.</p><p>Luckily, there are several ways you can actually do that. Read on to learn more about these options so you can decide on the best solution for your money needs.</p><h2 id=6-ways-to-make-up-to-324-per-day>6 ways to make up to $324 per day</h2><h3>1. Drive for Uber or Lyft</h3><p>Becoming a rideshare driver is pretty simple. You can sign up online if you meet local and company age requirements, and have an active license. Most rideshare companies require you to submit to a background check. You’ll also need to provide proof of residency and proof of insurance.</p><p>Once approved, you can start driving to make extra cash. If you have the flexibility in your schedule, consider working during peak hours when you’re likely to earn more money.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $7.25 to $40.50 per hour</strong>.</p><h3>2. Earn cash through Swagbucks</h3><h3 class=product-title>Get paid to take surveys with Swagbucks</h3><p>Average pay</p><p>$0.40 – $2</p><p>Payment method</p><p>Paypal or gift cards</p><p>Minimum to cash out</p><p>$3 for gift cards; $25 for PayPal</p><p>Promotion</p><p>$10</p><p>If you spend a lot of time in front of a screen, consider <a href=# rel=alternate>online surveys</a>. <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Swagbucks</a> is a unique platform that rewards users with points for completing specific online tasks. Once you reach 2,500 points, you can cash out using PayPal or exchange the points for gift cards.</p><p>Here are some ways you can earn <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Swagbucks</a> points:</p><ul><li>Answer surveys.</li><li>Play games.</li><li>Try free samples or free trials.</li><li>Use Swagbucks’s proprietary search engine.</li><li>Shop online.</li><li>Invite friends to the platform.</li></ul><p>You’re not likely to make a ton of money through <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>Swagbucks</a>, but you can certainly make a few extra dollars here and there.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $1 to $5 per day</strong>.</p><h3>3. Become a personal shopper through Shipt</h3><p>Shipt is a personal shopping platform where you can earn money by shopping for customers. Shipt customers place orders for groceries, household items, and more from local stores, and personal shoppers will purchase and deliver the goods to the customer’s home.</p><p>To become a personal shopper, you must be at least 18 years old, have a valid driver’s license and auto insurance, and have a reliable vehicle. Once you sign up, you can claim jobs and get to work. You’ll receive base pay for all jobs and 100% of any tip the customer leaves. You’ll also be eligible for bonuses.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $14 to $20 per hour</strong>.</p><h3>4. Pick up shift work at a bar or restaurant</h3><p>Do you have experience bartending or serving? Consider picking up a few shifts each week at a local bar or restaurant. The easiest way to do this is to go in person and ask if they need any help. Alternatively, you can use platforms like shiftNOW or Evershift to find temporary work, including restaurant or bar shifts.</p><p>Pay will depend on your experience and geographic location. Areas with a higher cost of living will likely pay more for shift work than rural locations. You may also earn higher tips serving at a high-end restaurant than at a small local place or a value chain.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $17.56 per hour.</strong></p><h3>5. Donate plasma</h3><p>Plasma is a part of human blood that can help burn, trauma, and cancer patients. When you donate plasma, your blood runs through a machine that separates the plasma from the rest of the blood, and returns the red blood cells and platelets to your body. If your blood type is AB, <a href=# rel=nofollow>your plasma can be used universally</a>, making it extremely valuable in medicine.</p><p>You can donate plasma once every 28 days or up to 13 times yearly. The process takes around an hour and a quarter, and you are paid per donation. The exact amount depends on the plasma center, though making several hundred dollars per month is possible.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $30 to $70 per donation</strong>.</p><h3>6. Sell unused gift cards</h3><h3 class=product-title>Paypal</h3><p>Fees</p><p>From free to 5%, depending on transfer type</p><p>Description</p><p>Up to $60,000 per transaction for verified accounts</p><p>Am rating</p><p>200+</p><p>Several platforms allow you to <a href=# rel=alternate>sell your unused gift cards for cash</a>. Apps like CardSell deposit cash in your <a class=affiliate-link-link href=# rel=nofollow>PayPal</a> account within 48 hours of the sale. You can also list them on gift card exchange websites like CardCash, Raise, ClipKard, or GiftCash. Payment methods vary depending on the website.</p><p><strong>Average pay: Varies</strong>.</p><h2 id=other-ways-to-get-money-fast>Other ways to get money fast</h2><p>If none of the above options sound doable, there are several other ways to get money quickly.</p><h3>Use a cash advance app</h3><h4>Get quick cash, no credit check</h4><p><a href=# rel=alternate>Cash advance apps</a> allow you to borrow money you’ve already made before you receive your paycheck. The funds will be deposited into your account within a few business days—though many apps give you the option of a faster payout in exchange for a fee.</p><p>Once your paycheck hits your account, the advance is automatically repaid. While this repayment method means you don’t have to remember to repay the loan, the withdrawal could cause you to overdraft your account if you don’t have sufficient funds.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $10 to $500</strong>.</p><h3>See if you have unclaimed funds</h3><p>You may have money out there that you don’t even know exists. When a business or financial institution owes you money, and you don’t collect it, it becomes “unclaimed funds.” Claiming those funds can give you a quick cash injection to help you pay off debt or your bills.</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=nofollow>search your state’s unclaimed property office</a> to find unclaimed money. There are additional databases to search, which you can access via <a href=# rel=nofollow>USA.gov</a>.</p><p><strong>Average pay: Varies</strong>.</p><h3>Rent out a parking space</h3><p>Do you live in an area with a high volume of special events? Or perhaps your house is located in a tourist haven. Either way, if there’s demand, you could rent a parking space at your home in exchange for cash.</p><p>There are several platforms on which you can list your space for rent, including:</p><ul><li>ParkingCupid.</li><li>Spacer.</li><li>Neighbor (which also lets you rent out unused space—garage, room—for storage).</li></ul><p>Once you’ve chosen a platform, you can submit the info about your parking space. If approved, you can begin renting it out immediately. You can decide on a rental price based on your location and how much others in your area charge.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $100 to $350 per month</strong>.</p><h3>Rent out your car</h3><p>Similar to how such sites as Airbnb and Vrbo allow you to rent out a room or an entire home, sites including Turo and Getaround let you rent out your car. This can be an excellent way to make passive income if your vehicle spends most of its time parked in your driveway.</p><p>To qualify, your car must be in good condition and meet specific criteria the car-share company sets. For example, Getaround requires vehicles to be at least model year 2007 and have less than 200,000 miles on the odometer, among other requirements.</p><p><strong>Average pay: $10,868 per year</strong>.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-need-money-quickly-you-have-options>TIME Stamp: Need money quickly? You have options</h2><p>There are numerous ways to make quick money in one day. From rideshare driving to restaurant shift work to plasma donations, you’re sure to find something to suit your needs.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How can I make money ASAP today?</h3><p>The quickest way to make money ASAP is to sell items you own, such as clothes, electronics, or gift cards. However, if you’re looking for a longer-term solution, consider getting shift work or becoming a rideshare driver.</p><h3>How can I earn $100 daily?</h3><p>To earn $100 per day, you’ll need to make $12.50 per hour, assuming you work eight hours. If you want to make money outside your day job, consider starting a <a href=# rel=alternate>side hustle</a> or renting your car or parking space to make extra cash.</p><h3>How can I make $1,000 in 24 hours?</h3><p>It’s a lot harder to make $1,000 in a day than it is to make $100—but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. If you have high-end goods or luxury items, list them for sale or take them to a pawn shop to see how much you can get. A side hustle could earn you $1,000 in a day, but it’ll take a while to build up to that.</p><h3>How can I make money in just hours?</h3><p>Making money in hours is possible. Consider taking online surveys, playing games, and watching videos using an app such as Swagbucks. Alternatively, list items for sale online or take them to a pawn shop for an instant cash payment. (Pawn shops won’t get you the most money for your item, but they pay out immediately. It can be a loan or a sale—and if you don’t pay back the loan it becomes a sale. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Be cautious</a>.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8qbvWZquoZZ2WuKZ50K6gnKNdoryvsdhmoKdln6OybrDAsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./must-read-books-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I'm Glad My Mom Died: 100 Must-Read Books of 2022">&larr;
