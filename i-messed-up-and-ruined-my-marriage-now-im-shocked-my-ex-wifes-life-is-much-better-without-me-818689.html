Moms and dads often say that they feel immense <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for their children, and state that they didn’t even think their life was possible prior to&nbsp;having kids. But having a&nbsp;child can impact the <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> between two parents, for better or&nbsp;worse.</p><p>A&nbsp;man recentlywrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and shared how having a&nbsp;baby led to&nbsp;the breakdown of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. Below, you’ll find his full story with all of&nbsp;the regrets this man is&nbsp;now having.</p><p><h2>Becoming a&nbsp;parent completely changed the man’s life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d47/bf7/6488b9515caaef9da75ddd9305.jpg><p>Adam, 38, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, where he&nbsp;honestly shared his pity <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> story and expressed all his thoughts and regrets about the situation.</p><p>Adam wrote that now he&nbsp;realized that he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wrong, but earlier he&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;blind person. The man opened his letter, saying, “I’m not looking for pity or&nbsp;understanding from you and your readers. I’m sure I’m not even getting&nbsp;it. But I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;story to&nbsp;make other men in&nbsp;my&nbsp;situation to&nbsp;probably think twice before behaving like&nbsp;I once did.”</p><p>Adam wrote, “Me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;ex-wife Joleen have a&nbsp;15-months-old son. We&nbsp;had been trying hard to&nbsp;conceive, and my&nbsp;wife Joleen went through some serious medical treatment before this ever became possible. I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;cloud nine when&nbsp;I found out she’s finally pregnant, and she was very happy, too. I&nbsp;always knew she would make a&nbsp;great mom, and&nbsp;I was never tired of&nbsp;telling her&nbsp;so. But things between&nbsp;us drastically changed after our son was born.”</p><p><h2>The relationship between the spouses was getting very tense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec3/d78/3aaa3950499ea58d36d35db167.jpg><p>Adam continued his story, saying, that despite their son being a&nbsp;long-awaited and a&nbsp;very desirable child for both of&nbsp;them, things went very wrong from the very beginning of&nbsp;their parenthood.</p><p>The man revealed, “After our baby was born, our marriage fell apart. Joleen was always complaining that&nbsp;I wasn’t pulling my&nbsp;weight with childcare and chores. But at&nbsp;the same time, she always expected me&nbsp;to&nbsp;know what to&nbsp;do, without telling me&nbsp;or&nbsp;explaining anything to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;often had to&nbsp;play guessing games, and it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;annoying.”</p><p>Adam confessed, “The situation between&nbsp;us was really bad. We&nbsp;argued a&nbsp;lot, and there were many fights because of&nbsp;some real trifles, and this was exhausting for&nbsp;us both. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;telling Joleen that her life would be&nbsp;harder without&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Adam explained that she didn’t even expect such a&nbsp;calm reaction from his wife after he&nbsp;uttered those words. He&nbsp;said, “Joleen got really quiet and just said that this was the end of&nbsp;the argument, and she wasn’t going to&nbsp;bear it&nbsp;anymore. It&nbsp;made things fall apart and soon we&nbsp;both filed for <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>.”</p><p><h2>The spouses live each their own life now, but Adam is&nbsp;not satisfied by&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/053/619/cd960f5d3f8a105ea3d5bb0a9c.jpg><p>Adam wrote, “We’re living separately now, each of&nbsp;us got a&nbsp;new apartment. As&nbsp;for our son, we&nbsp;share an&nbsp;equal percentage of&nbsp;custody over him due to&nbsp;our law. This is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;automatic until one parents proves neglect on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the other one. We&nbsp;really don’t have that situation, so&nbsp;both of&nbsp;our lawyers advised&nbsp;us to&nbsp;split time and do&nbsp;alternating weeks since we&nbsp;separated, and we&nbsp;followed this advice.”</p><p>Adam then confessed, “I&nbsp;knew that being a&nbsp;single parent wasn’t that easy, but&nbsp;I didn’t fully realize how hard it&nbsp;was, until now. The weeks&nbsp;I get my&nbsp;son, I&nbsp;can’t really get anything done, and&nbsp;I must confess&nbsp;I can barely function. I’m literally exhausted. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;spend the time when&nbsp;I don’t have my&nbsp;son on&nbsp;catching up&nbsp;the things&nbsp;I missed when&nbsp;I was taking care of&nbsp;him. My&nbsp;apartment is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mess and&nbsp;I can hardly keep up&nbsp;with errands and chores.”</p><p>Adam revealed, “I&nbsp;did think since&nbsp;I was having a&nbsp;hard time, my&nbsp;wife would be&nbsp;too, and we&nbsp;could even reunite on&nbsp;this basis. I&nbsp;expected that we&nbsp;would actually work on&nbsp;things between&nbsp;us. But she doesn’t want&nbsp;to. She says her life is&nbsp;<strong>easier</strong> now without&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Adam’s ex-wife seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;enjoying her life without him now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f41/4b0/3b04f1510ab94bef6e2affb229.jpg><p>Adam revealed, “Joleen said that she’s the opposite of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and, unlike&nbsp;me, she can pretty much keep things well-organized and done on&nbsp;time. She even claims she isn’t exhausted anymore, and she realized that taking care of&nbsp;one person instead of&nbsp;two has made her life so&nbsp;much better.”</p><p>Adam confessed, “I&nbsp;know&nbsp;I messed&nbsp;up, and&nbsp;I should have been a&nbsp;better husband. I&nbsp;can’t even ask about less time with my&nbsp;son, because&nbsp;I can’t afford the child support at&nbsp;the moment. Right now, neither of&nbsp;us has any, because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;50/50 split of&nbsp;duties and equal income. But if&nbsp;we&nbsp;go&nbsp;off this equal split, my&nbsp;lawyer says the person with less time will get child support.<br>I’m mad about the whole situation now, and&nbsp;I regret my&nbsp;previous choices, and what&nbsp;I said to&nbsp;Joleen was totally inappropriate. The only person who’s having a&nbsp;hard life now is&nbsp;me, and this is&nbsp;so&nbsp;sad for&nbsp;me.”</p><p>And here’s yet another confession from a&nbsp;woman, who took a&nbsp;<a href=#>married man</a> away from his family and kids. The woman expected a&nbsp;paradise, but her life with this man turned into a&nbsp;total nightmare, and now she’s left with nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuucSsqp6cXaq9bq3NnWSrrZmjsqV5zLJkppmip7ais8RmpaivXZ66br%2FHqJqknZRiurp5xLFksKGWmsBuuMifnGaho2K6tq%2FHZpmerKSav27DyK2fqK2kYrqmeZdqb29waWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./les-services-des-impots-preparent-leur-retour-dans-les-territoires.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Les services des impts prparent leur retour dans les territoires">&larr;
