The shock she felt was overwhelming, and it forced her to confront deep-seated expectations and cultural norms that she had never fully considered.</p><p>My husband comes from a traditional family where his mother is a stay-at-home wife and his father is the sole provider. In stark contrast, my mother instilled in me from a young age the importance of never being financially dependent on a man.</p><p>My husband has worked hard to unlearn the values he grew up with. He pulls his weight at home, is an engaged father, and a genuine partner. However, he places an excessive amount of importance on his family's opinions. I understand the desire to make one's parents proud, but this often goes too far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05d/476/eb44cc551ea91fc5da261e96f6.jpg><p>Currently, my in-laws are staying with us for two weeks. Normally, I prepare breakfast, we all have lunch at work or school, and my husband cooks dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday, so we're all pitching in with the cleaning. This system has always worked for us.</p><p>My in-laws, however, despise my "modern" approach to life. They dislike that I work, that I don't find my sole purpose in being a wife and mother, and that my husband shares household responsibilities. We had a frank discussion early on, where I set my boundaries and made it clear that I wouldn't tolerate <a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> about how I live my life in my own home. When I'm a guest in their home, I respect their ways and act as the daughter-in-law they wish I was. They've mostly respected this arrangement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dbf/20e/aa182459359b852021e58978bc.jpg><p>Yesterday, I came home from work exhausted and hungry. I usually arrive around 6:15 or 6:30 PM, and we eat at 7 PM. After greeting everyone, I took a quick shower before dinner. When I came downstairs, I found that nothing had been prepared.</p><p>I asked my husband about it, but he wouldn't look at me. His mother answered instead, saying he hadn't cooked anything because I needed to fulfill my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My husband still avoided eye contact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/007/846/65bc48558d9d72aeec37bccbdb.jpg><p>Frustrated, I ordered takeout, served myself and our children, and we sat down to eat. My husband and his parents joined us after serving themselves.</p><p>My mother-in-law continued to criticize me, calling me a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He sided with his mother, suggesting that it wouldn't hurt if I acted "more like a proper woman" and "took better care of my home and children." He added that tradition exists for a reason, and it was insulting that I thought I was too good for the way he was raised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/644/b97/52c39b5316998b4081bae52854.jpg><p>At this point, I might have crossed a line. I told him that tradition wouldn't allow a man earning 35k to support a family of five and that he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt, with tears welling up in his eyes, and excused himself from the table.</p><p>I regret saying this in front of our children, but dealing with his parents' criticism and cleaning up his mess was too much for me.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>"Should have ordered only enough food for you and the kids." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>WhyCommentQueasy / Reddit</a></li><li>"Next time the in-laws show up, just take the kids & leave.
