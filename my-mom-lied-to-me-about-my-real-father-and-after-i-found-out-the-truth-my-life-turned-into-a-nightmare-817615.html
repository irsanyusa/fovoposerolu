Only it&nbsp;happened to&nbsp;her for real, though she wished she had never faced such a&nbsp;dramatic accident in&nbsp;her own <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. The woman shared how she discovered that her mother lied to&nbsp;her about her biological dad, and how she found out the truth. After that, the woman’s life has never been calm again.</p><p><h2>The woman lived a&nbsp;normal life until one day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/615/727/feafb95972aef6dfa1a2d18c9d.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Alyson wrote to&nbsp;our editorial and told her intricate story. She began her letter, saying that she’s 25, her dad died when she was 8&nbsp;years old. And then Alyson makes the remark, saying, “Well, the man&nbsp;I believed was my&nbsp;dad.” Alyson’s mom dated other men after her husband’s death, but she’s never remarried or&nbsp;had a&nbsp;serious <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with anyone, so&nbsp;the woman has basically been without a&nbsp;dad since she was 8.</p><p>Then Alyson mentions that one day her life story took a&nbsp;totally unexpected turn. She wrote, “Two weeks ago, a&nbsp;man came into my&nbsp;work. I&nbsp;work at&nbsp;a&nbsp;cinema in&nbsp;the ticket stand. So&nbsp;this strange man came&nbsp;in, and he&nbsp;kept letting people go&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;him in&nbsp;line until&nbsp;I was done consulting the customer&nbsp;I was with. I&nbsp;didn’t even pay much attention to&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;first, but this man was really nervous, and he&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;me.”</p><p>The woman was really puzzled and even started panicking a&nbsp;bit. But the man asked her some ordinary questions. He&nbsp;asked Alyson about what she’d advise him to&nbsp;eat and wondered what kind of&nbsp;movies she liked. To&nbsp;Alyson, the guy seemed friendly but shy and the woman was just being polite and held a&nbsp;conversation like they’re supposed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;at&nbsp;work.</p><p>She wrote, “After our small polite talk, he&nbsp;left, and&nbsp;I didn’t meet him when his movie was over. When I&nbsp;finished my&nbsp;work and got home, that same man was in&nbsp;my&nbsp;living room. He&nbsp;was talking to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother and it&nbsp;just creeped me&nbsp;out. My&nbsp;mom was behaving weirdly, she even started panicking when&nbsp;I asked who the man was. She actually just kept saying he’s no&nbsp;one, and he’s already leaving.”</p><p><h2>Alyson discovered a&nbsp;family secret that her mom was keeping from her all these years.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/068/680/e2f91a54c5a9474137cc9983e2.jpg><p>After Alyson’s mom was pushing the stranger to&nbsp;leave, he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away and actually started talking to&nbsp;Alyson. He&nbsp;was very persistent and ultimately said he&nbsp;wasn’t leaving until they talked and said mom needs to&nbsp;tell her daughter the truth.</p><p>The woman wrote, “Well, you can guess maybe, he&nbsp;said he’s my&nbsp;father. I&nbsp;just felt a&nbsp;strong twist in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach. My&nbsp;mother started rambling, and she insisted that my&nbsp;dad that died was my&nbsp;real dad. She kept repeating how much he&nbsp;loved me&nbsp;and took care of&nbsp;me, and that this doesn’t change that. I&nbsp;just yelled at&nbsp;her that she could’ve told me&nbsp;earlier that he&nbsp;wasn’t my&nbsp;biological father, but she kept it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret.”</p><p>Alyson asked if&nbsp;the man was telling the truth, and then her mother just started crying and nodding. Alyson said that it&nbsp;was only at&nbsp;that moment that she looked at&nbsp;the man and noticed that he&nbsp;really looked so&nbsp;much like her. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her and even swore he&nbsp;never knew Alyson existed, or&nbsp;he&nbsp;would’ve been in&nbsp;his daughter’s life.</p><p>Alyson just asked her mother if&nbsp;the man was dangerous or&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic&nbsp;ex. The stranger was offended, and her mom also assured her it&nbsp;wasn’t that at&nbsp;all. They both wanted to&nbsp;sit down and talk, but Alyson just felt so&nbsp;angry and overwhelmed, so&nbsp;she just took her things and went away.</p><p><h2>Alyson finally discovered all details about her childhood and real dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/26b/108/a6b3895d639a78d4340d6263c9.jpg><p>Alyson had some time to&nbsp;think things over, and she decided she wanted to&nbsp;know the whole story. She returned home and talked to&nbsp;her mom. It&nbsp;turned out her bio father really has never been a&nbsp;bad man, and her mom didn’t cheat on&nbsp;Alyson’s adoptive dad. Alyson wrote that she was an&nbsp;“accidental child” and her mother got pregnant with her while she didn’t plan&nbsp;it.</p><p>The circumstances were that Alyson’s mom didn’t even know the exact name of&nbsp;her real dad at&nbsp;that time. This all happened before <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> was a&nbsp;thing, so&nbsp;she couldn’t just find him online like all of&nbsp;us can do&nbsp;nowadays. So&nbsp;she made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;just raise her daughter on&nbsp;her own.</p><p>Alyson’s mother also admitted she was panicking hard when Alyson’s bio dad showed up&nbsp;because to&nbsp;her, he&nbsp;was literally just a&nbsp;man she knew for one night many years ago. The woman didn’t know who he&nbsp;was now or&nbsp;any other details about his life.</p><p>As&nbsp;for Alyson’s adoptive dad (the man that raised her), her mom said she married him when Alyson was 3&nbsp;years old. He&nbsp;officially adopted her after they tied the knot. Alyson realized that she had never seen photos of&nbsp;her and her adoptive dad together when she was a&nbsp;<a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a>. Just pictures of&nbsp;herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;toddler and older.</p><p><h2>Alyson decided to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;touch with her bio dad, but things went tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4db/909/59bbda52b78907ac8dd48e1969.jpg><p>Alyson decided to&nbsp;call her bio dad and arrange a&nbsp;meeting with him, too. When they finally met, she asked him how he&nbsp;even found out about her. He&nbsp;replied that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;son who is&nbsp;only 7&nbsp;months younger than Alyson. So&nbsp;his wife is&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher, and she came across a&nbsp;picture that the school of&nbsp;Alyson’s daughter posted on&nbsp;their website.</p><p>On&nbsp;that photo, Alyson was together with her daughter and her face was clearly seen. Her dad’s wife sent the photo to&nbsp;her dad, thinking Alyson might be&nbsp;related to&nbsp;him because they really looked very alike. He&nbsp;then found Alyson’s <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>, thinking she was his brother’s daughter at&nbsp;first.</p><p>He&nbsp;and his brother hadn’t spoken for over 20&nbsp;years, so&nbsp;this version was pretty much suitable. And then, in&nbsp;Alyson’s Instagram, he&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;her and her mom and recognized her. From that very moment, he&nbsp;knew Alyson was his daughter.</p><p><h2>The biggest trouble showed up&nbsp;after Alyson met her half-brother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f75/74c/58961f56c1b2a77da73c8c675a.jpg><p>Alyson wrote, “My&nbsp;bio dad told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;son, Ryan, who’s just 7&nbsp;months younger than I. I&nbsp;was very excited to&nbsp;meet him, as&nbsp;I seriously thought&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;build that family ties with my&nbsp;dad and with his family. I&nbsp;supposed we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;friends with Ryan, at&nbsp;least we&nbsp;would communicate. But things did take a&nbsp;turn right at&nbsp;our first meeting with him.”</p><p>When Alyson came to&nbsp;her bio dad’s house to&nbsp;meet his wife, Serena, and his son, Ryan, she was surprised at&nbsp;how good Serena treated her from the start. The woman was very cordial, and she made compliments to&nbsp;Alyson, also trying to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;common topic to&nbsp;talk about. But Ryan went simply hysterical, he&nbsp;would call Alyson mean names, right from the start, and even started mocking her looks, saying that she’s dressed like a&nbsp;“light-minded woman”.</p><p>Alyson couldn’t stand that and accepted the fact that Ryan was stressed, though she decided to&nbsp;never ever communicate with him again. The woman thought that was the end of&nbsp;their relationship, when Ryan suddenly started sending messages to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;her friends on&nbsp;Facebook, telling them that Alyson was breaking their family and that she was not the daughter but the lover of&nbsp;his dad. He&nbsp;kept inventing dirty stories, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;real pleasure for him to&nbsp;watch people cutting ties with Alyson, shaming her and making a&nbsp;real mess out of&nbsp;Alyson’s life.</p><p>The woman wrote that Ryan is&nbsp;still chasing her, and he&nbsp;somehow found out the place where she works and started contacting her colleagues, too. She doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;now, as&nbsp;she sincerely wants to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;warm relationship with her bio dad and Serena, but Ryan’s behavior is&nbsp;just making it&nbsp;all impossible.</p><p><h2>We’d advise Alyson to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;all members of&nbsp;her, now big, family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b2/b1d/4a518155fea3a45f50923936e6.jpg><p>We’re grateful to&nbsp;Alyson for her trust to&nbsp;our editorial and for sharing her exceptional family story with&nbsp;us.</p><p>We’d advise the woman to&nbsp;take the situation into her own hands and to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;each of&nbsp;her family members about Ryan. Since she hasn’t known him until recently, she may not have enough understanding of&nbsp;his outrageous behavior. Ryan might have had a&nbsp;trauma in&nbsp;the past, which he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now projecting on&nbsp;Alyson, against his will, just because he&nbsp;feels hurt by&nbsp;her presence in&nbsp;his family’s life.</p><p>Alyson should talk to&nbsp;Serena, as&nbsp;she’s the woman who knows Ryan best of&nbsp;all, and she’s his mom. Since Serena is&nbsp;so&nbsp;cordial towards Alyson, they may have a&nbsp;very sincere conversation and try to&nbsp;work out an&nbsp;approach that would be&nbsp;the best for everyone. Also, Alyson’s bio dad should know about what’s happening and take measures on&nbsp;his end, too. If&nbsp;he’s interested in&nbsp;maintaining a&nbsp;good relationship with his newly found daughter, he&nbsp;should play his part in&nbsp;this whole drama and be&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who would help them all to&nbsp;resolve this pity conflict.</p><p>And here’s yet another dramatic story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband took a&nbsp;paternity test on&nbsp;their daughter, and it&nbsp;came back negative, but the woman insists she never <a href=#>cheated</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyopGakmZqxbsDOZqSeZZGXvLbAjKawZqqVlrlussCtn56qXZa7pXnAn6ueql2eeqe71KebZqelqXq1tMRmq6utpJ16rsWMpaCfnV2pwrO6xJ1koqakpHqiec2inqGsnZa%2FpnmXam5vaWVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./presentation-du-decret-instituant-un-commissaire-general-pour-le-developpement-de-la-vallee-de-la.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Prsentation du dcret instituant un commissaire gnral pour le dveloppement de la valle de">&larr;
