Being not related to&nbsp;each other by&nbsp;blood, they may find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;common language in&nbsp;their <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>. For today’s <a href=# title=heroine data-link=tag>heroine</a>, it&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just the case, and her stepdaughter was far from being an&nbsp;angel with her behavior. But one day, she really became an&nbsp;angel for her stepmom and saved her and her <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a>. The grateful woman posted about this on&nbsp;Reddit, and many people couldn’t hold back tears after reading her story.</p><p><h2>The woman came to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;tell her mind-boggling story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad7/ab9/b4bc625f629b432c462a29a0fc.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, who has suddenly experienced a&nbsp;big shock in&nbsp;her life, has come to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the Reddit communities to&nbsp;ask people for a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice. However, this wasn’t just a&nbsp;mere advice that she needed about her situation, she asked people to&nbsp;help her express her gratitude to&nbsp;her stepdaughter who did an&nbsp;impossible thing for her and her baby.</p><p>The woman began her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, saying, that there was a&nbsp;day in&nbsp;her life when she felt helpless and needed someone around so&nbsp;badly.</p><p>She wrote, «So&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks ago&nbsp;I was 36&nbsp;weeks pregnant with my&nbsp;son, On&nbsp;this day, my&nbsp;husband had left at&nbsp;8&nbsp;am and took our two younger children to&nbsp;his parent’s house and my&nbsp;stepdaughter had already left for the day, to&nbsp;get her senior class schedule and do&nbsp;a&nbsp;few other things done for the school year.»</p><p>The woman was absolutely alone and, unexpectedly, things were out of&nbsp;her control. She said, «I&nbsp;was home alone when all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden&nbsp;I went into labor, I&nbsp;had been cleaning the kid’s bathroom, when&nbsp;I realized&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I only needed to&nbsp;use the toilet, I&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pressure and when&nbsp;I looked down&nbsp;My babies feet were hanging out, I&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;move onto the floor and then realized&nbsp;I was bleeding out, I&nbsp;couldn’t move&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;scream for help hoping a&nbsp;neighbor or&nbsp;a&nbsp;passerby would notice.»</p><p><h2>The woman’s step daughter became her hero.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d3/474/c03ca15a2892aa05bb833350be.jpg><p>The woman named her post in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that hints to&nbsp;the people that her relationship with her stepdaughter was a&nbsp;tad tough previously. She titled the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, «<strong>My&nbsp;stepdaughter went from crazy hormonal teen to&nbsp;sweet <a href=# title=loving data-link=tag>loving</a> teen after she saved both my&nbsp;baby and my&nbsp;own lives.»</strong></p><p>But this «crazy hormonal teen» has unexpectedly become a&nbsp;real angel for the woman and her baby.</p><p>The woman wrote, «I&nbsp;don’t know how long&nbsp;I was on&nbsp;the floor for but it&nbsp;felt like hours, but after a&nbsp;while, I&nbsp;heard the front door open then close and&nbsp;I screamed out, My&nbsp;stepdaughter ran upstairs to&nbsp;find me&nbsp;on&nbsp;the bathroom floor, she went to&nbsp;get some towels and grabbed her phone to&nbsp;call 911. I&nbsp;knew she was terrified and had to&nbsp;grab her hand to&nbsp;give her reassurance. The operator on&nbsp;the phone pretty much told her she had to&nbsp;deliver the baby herself until the ambulance got there.»</p><p>The young lady demonstrated such dedication in&nbsp;her wish to&nbsp;help, that the woman was shocked. She wrote, «She followed everything the operator and delivered my&nbsp;baby boy, when&nbsp;My baby was out he&nbsp;wasn’t breathing so&nbsp;she pretty much tore the bathroom apart looking for a&nbsp;nasal aspirator, by&nbsp;the time she got the baby to&nbsp;breathe again, the ems had arrived, where both me&nbsp;and baby were taken to&nbsp;the hospital. Later&nbsp;on, when my&nbsp;husband arrived at&nbsp;the hospital the doctor told them if&nbsp;my&nbsp;stepdaughter hadn’t come home when she did, Both me&nbsp;and the baby would have died.»</p><p><h2>The girl showed great love and care after the baby was finally born.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0f/a72/f9bc6959f3a9998bf9982b7912.jpg><p>The woman revealed that after her baby was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> and things settled in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, her stepdaughter remained loving and caring towards everyone.</p><p>She wrote, «Even after both me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;baby were able to&nbsp;come home, my&nbsp;husband hadn’t been able to&nbsp;take off time yet so&nbsp;my&nbsp;stepdaughter took it&nbsp;upon herself to&nbsp;cancel all plans with her friends, and look after the kids while I&nbsp;rested, cooked dinner and cleaned the house as&nbsp;well.»</p><p>The woman confessed that she had to&nbsp;rethink her attitude to&nbsp;the girl. She explained, «That and on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;all that has been my&nbsp;rock, In&nbsp;all honesty, these 3&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;I have gotten to&nbsp;know her more than in&nbsp;the 11&nbsp;years&nbsp;I have been her stepmom. I&nbsp;have never been for thankful for what she has done.»</p><p>Now the woman wanted a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice from Redditors. She wrote, «I&nbsp;mentioned to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband last night&nbsp;I feel like she needs a&nbsp;gift or&nbsp;something to&nbsp;show her thankful for what she has done. Neither of&nbsp;us can think of&nbsp;anything though. any ideas?»</p><p><h2>People on&nbsp;Reddit were bursting with emotions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f0/816/9801405637b2398a0d899bc673.jpg><p>People were very much impressed by&nbsp;the woman’s story.</p><p>One person immediately commented, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «Gifts are nice but don’t forget to&nbsp;voice your feelings as&nbsp;well that’s also very important.»</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «Hey crazy hormonal teen here from what&nbsp;I gathered your daughter is&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior if&nbsp;I’m not mistaken?</p><p>Well If&nbsp;I&nbsp;were you I’d ask her directly because idk if&nbsp;it’s just me&nbsp;but&nbsp;I usually prefer when my&nbsp;parents ask me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I want something instead of&nbsp;them guessing what I’d like. While this would ruin the surprise&nbsp;I feel like it’d be&nbsp;surprise enough just her realizing you’re getting her a&nbsp;gift.</p><p>Basically, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fellow teen, I&nbsp;think you should just ask her if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;anything she would like as&nbsp;a&nbsp;thank you.»</p><p>And another one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Does she wear jewelry? Could you get her a&nbsp;nice necklace or&nbsp;ring with the date of&nbsp;your son’s birthday inscribed on&nbsp;it?»</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story from a&nbsp;woman, who wasn’t so&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;loving and caring daughter of&nbsp;her own. She had to&nbsp;kick her daughter out of&nbsp;the house, despite she was <a href=#>pregnant</a> and had 6&nbsp;kids, and the reason made our hearts sink.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKtnKlllJbCqLTTnqlmoaNirm6v0ZqxsmWYpL%2Buu82ao2aslZq7bq3NnWSsoJViwKLCxJ1kprFdlrulecyyZJuZkq7AbrjIr5ysZWhmhHqEkWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hollywood-sign-rivals-the-statue-of-liberty-1200654843.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Hollywood Sign: Unlikely Rival for the Statue of Liberty">&larr;
