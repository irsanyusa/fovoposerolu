Because of&nbsp;his qualities, he&nbsp;was tasked with protecting their kingdom. Dwarfs were known to&nbsp;gather a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;wealth, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;added security was a&nbsp;must. I&nbsp;mean, they lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house made from <a href=# title=gold data-link=tag>gold</a> and precious gems.</p><p>But Fafnir also had another special talent: he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;shapeshift! Tricked by&nbsp;Loki, the Norse spirit of&nbsp;mischief, Fafnir was taken over by&nbsp;his greed and the shine of&nbsp;his father’s treasure. He&nbsp;decided he&nbsp;did not want to&nbsp;share any of&nbsp;it, not even with his father or&nbsp;his brothers. He&nbsp;stole it&nbsp;and ran away all by&nbsp;himself to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place he’d be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;find: the middle of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=desert data-link=tag>desert</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/02a/fe5/46184e56e9b7f73319c53acc32.png><p>To&nbsp;protect his wealth, Fafnir transformed into a&nbsp;huge dragon. His new appearance looked like a&nbsp;huge snake, powerful and scary. His magical powers did not end there, though. Because the dragon couldn’t fly, he&nbsp;also spread poison all around his new home, so&nbsp;no&nbsp;one had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;survive if&nbsp;they wanted to&nbsp;take his gold away.</p><p>Fafnir was soon defeated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;young <a href=# title=hero data-link=tag>hero</a> named Sigurd. The legend of&nbsp;Fafnir tries to&nbsp;explain why <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> is&nbsp;more important than greed. It&nbsp;also shows the many magical powers dragons possess. But the most interesting part is&nbsp;that it’s quite a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;how dragons came to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;our tales.</p><p>But hey, this is&nbsp;just one of&nbsp;the many stories mentioning dragons. Just switch on&nbsp;your&nbsp;<a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a> or&nbsp;peek into any bookstore, and you’ll surely stumble upon dragons somewhere. Variations of&nbsp;dragon-like creatures have been described in&nbsp;stories from all over the world, from Asia to&nbsp;Northern Europe. Most of&nbsp;these creatures are depicted with reptile-like bodies, <a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a>, and claws. And the scariest trait of&nbsp;them all: they can breathe fire out of&nbsp;their mouths!</p><p>The name of&nbsp;these creatures comes from the Latin word ’draconem,’ which translates to ’huge serpent.’ But let’s take a&nbsp;trip down memory lane to&nbsp;see how it&nbsp;all started. An&nbsp;Asian historian, for example, discovered some fossils back in&nbsp;the 4th century BCE and decided that he’d stumbled upon dragons. It’s easy to&nbsp;understand why he&nbsp;got so&nbsp;confused if&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fossilized stegosaurus. It&nbsp;was 30&nbsp;feet long, 14&nbsp;feet tall, and covered in&nbsp;armored plates and spikes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e9/8e3/07a6f75c66b4b197080e8ed689.png><p>The Nile crocodile might have gotten mistaken for a&nbsp;dragon, too. It&nbsp;still exists today and lives in&nbsp;sub-Saharan Africa. But it&nbsp;may have been more popular in&nbsp;ancient times. When reaching maturity, Nile crocodiles can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;18&nbsp;feet long. But that’s not all: it&nbsp;can even walk with its body off the ground, and some were even pictured standing on&nbsp;their two back legs!</p><p>Goannas are dragon-like lizards that live in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>. Large as&nbsp;they are, they also have razor-sharp teeth and claws and are known to&nbsp;even produce venom. It’s easy to&nbsp;see why goannas may be&nbsp;the source for the Australian version of&nbsp;dragons.</p><p>When humans first discovered whale bones back in&nbsp;the day, we&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea these animals lived in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=sea data-link=tag>sea</a>. Given their size, we&nbsp;surely must have thought they were dangerous. And because we&nbsp;rarely see whales (if&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;underwater, of&nbsp;course), they were poorly understood and easily mistaken for dragons, too. Probably the most interesting source of&nbsp;dragon mythology is&nbsp;actually the human brain.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;book called “An&nbsp;Instinct for Dragons,” there was a&nbsp;theory which claimed that dragons existed in&nbsp;almost all ancient cultures because we&nbsp;had evolved to&nbsp;fear large predators to&nbsp;survive. We&nbsp;aren’t the only mammals to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this: monkeys have an&nbsp;innate fear of&nbsp;snakes and large cats, too, for example. When you combine these natural traits with folklore, you get a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;dragon stories everywhere, adapted to&nbsp;each region.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/313/808/1e90845028bda8e8b787925f84.png><p>Reptilian beasts with magical powers date back as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;the origins of&nbsp;human civilization itself. I’m talking about ancient Mesopotamia. Humans back then used to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;creatures. But their head spirit was Marduk, the patron of&nbsp;the City of&nbsp;Babylon.</p><p>If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;the artwork from back then, Marduk was depicted with a&nbsp;snake-like dragon at&nbsp;his side. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;either nice or&nbsp;vengeful, depending on&nbsp;what mood it&nbsp;was&nbsp;in. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;sign up&nbsp;to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;dragon, the first thing they’ll ask you at&nbsp;the interview will be&nbsp;if&nbsp;you can breathe fire, of&nbsp;course. So, scientists have tried to&nbsp;look into some ways that could make it&nbsp;real for dragons to&nbsp;breathe out fire without damaging their throats. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;that, they examined the bombardier beetle.</p><p>This eccentric insect can pack up&nbsp;some really hot substances in&nbsp;its belly. Once the creature gets bothered by&nbsp;something, it&nbsp;shoots out a&nbsp;fiery load of&nbsp;chemicals. In&nbsp;all fairness, it’s not really fire, but it&nbsp;does burn&nbsp;— so&nbsp;it’s close enough. Going back to&nbsp;dragons, they’d need to&nbsp;have similar glands in&nbsp;their throats to&nbsp;produce the same effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/26e/385/e8980f50dab2c7efd0d9d99be4.png><p>But where do&nbsp;dragons come from? They didn’t just appear out of&nbsp;nowhere, regardless of&nbsp;the source you consult. Some tales, like that of&nbsp;Fafnir, say that even humans can turn into dragons. But the most popular theory is&nbsp;that dragons start out as&nbsp;eggs.</p><p>Some sources even draft a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;stages a&nbsp;dragon has to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through during its life. Everything starts with hatching. Dragons are said to&nbsp;eat their way out of&nbsp;those shells and break the sides of&nbsp;the egg. Then there’s the wyrmling stage, which is&nbsp;what dragon specialists&nbsp;— or&nbsp;dragonologists if&nbsp;you like&nbsp;— call a&nbsp;newly hatched dragon. It’s still small and weak. But don’t worry, it&nbsp;can take care of&nbsp;itself pretty well.</p><p>The rest of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dragon’s life stages are pretty self-explanatory: there are grown-up dragons, then ancient ones. A&nbsp;dragon’s life ends when it&nbsp;reaches the twilight stage. Some sources claim dragons never stopped growing. Others even say they never reach the end of&nbsp;their lives; they just pass on&nbsp;to&nbsp;another type of&nbsp;spiritual existence.</p><p>Dragons are known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the symbol of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different things, but that all depends on&nbsp;their origin. In&nbsp;some regions of&nbsp;Asia, they are known to&nbsp;bring luck, power, and wealth. To&nbsp;become a&nbsp;powerful warrior in&nbsp;Britain, you’d need to&nbsp;first defeat a&nbsp;dragon. That’s why you often see them on&nbsp;flags.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/62f/8a5/98d985505f9d52b65e70fc10c7.png><p>The flag of&nbsp;Wales, for example, has a&nbsp;large red dragon on&nbsp;a&nbsp;green and white background. Western stories aren’t as&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;dragons&nbsp;— they are often seen as&nbsp;evil and vengeful. Another myth associated with dragons is&nbsp;that they looove gold and precious stones. This greedy side of&nbsp;their temperament seems to&nbsp;date back to&nbsp;Ancient Greece, where dragons were tasked with guarding treasures. Some of&nbsp;these guarding dragons were seen in&nbsp;such tales as&nbsp;The Hobbit and in&nbsp;the Harry Potter series.</p><p>As&nbsp;for dragons’ magical abilities, they also vary a&nbsp;lot. Some were said to&nbsp;have blood with supernatural properties; some were rumored to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;speak; others were famous for their wisdom. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;dragons in&nbsp;ancient literature could fly or&nbsp;shapeshift&nbsp;— even into humans.</p><p>Some real-life creatures got their names thanks to&nbsp;bearing a&nbsp;resemblance to&nbsp;dragons. Like the dragonfly that has more than 5,000 subspecies we&nbsp;know about. It&nbsp;got its name from folklore tales, as&nbsp;Europeans in&nbsp;the Middle Ages saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;evil insect. Dragonflies were accused of&nbsp;some really nasty things, like biting people’s eyes and mouths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/103/fb1/acbd6c5acb88329b4f2cfd1b97.png><p>But the creature that resembles mythical dragons most is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reptile called the flying dragon. They’re seen in&nbsp;wooded areas of&nbsp;Southeast Asia.</p><p>They don’t really have wings, per&nbsp;se. But parts of&nbsp;their ribs are elongated to&nbsp;support some extra skin that allows them to&nbsp;leap through the air between trees. Those “wings” are also brightly colored and contrast with their brown bodies.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYytqa6dXZ22tMDOq7Bmp5ZisbOtxqilrGWnnbKzsYyfoKudXZe%2Fpq3ToaCnn12XsqK%2F06xknJmdmnqnvs6mZHFpZWp%2Bd3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./incendies-un-risque-attise-par-la-canicule-et-des-moyens-de-lutte-en-questions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="un risque attis par la canicule et des moyens de lutte en questions">&larr;
